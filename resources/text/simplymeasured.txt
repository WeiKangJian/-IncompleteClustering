"Black Friday… is your customer experience ladder about to fall? Blog post neldirautenbach Marketing Manager Synthetix Ltd Monday 9 Nov 2015 A good customer service strategy can be a competitive advantage during these peak times and the impact substantial to the success of a retailer. Share More social links Twitter Facebook Linkedin Google+ Black Friday… is your customer experience ladder about to fall?
The countdown to the shopping fever that is Black Friday, 27 November, has started with some of the UK’s biggest retailers launching deals 3 weeks ahead of the actual big day. But this ‘official’ start of the Christmas shopping season in the UK will not be the only ‘Black Friday’ putting pressure on staff in-store and within contact centres, increasing stress on retailer’s customer service departments.
Very superstitious November 2015 boasts two Black Fridays, Friday the 13 th - considered an unlucky day in Western superstition - and 27 November with Cyber Monday close on its heels as the busiest online shopping day of the year on 30 November.
Calling a Friday ‘Black’ could not have more different meanings in this month. For an estimated 21 million people in the US living in fear of Friday the 13 th , the colour has a negative connotation. However for retailers traditionally, profitability is noted down in black, while losses are noted in red, and with some people so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines - swopping their instore to online shopping, while others frantically look for online bargains and comparisons - the two ‘black’ Fridays for retailers, represent positive profits.
The writing’s on the wall A good customer service strategy can be a competitive advantage during these peak times and the impact substantial to the success of a retailer. However, Black Friday also coincides with retailers hiring of Christmas staff, who may be new to the job and not used to having to deal with an influx in customer contact.
Customers have their favourite brands, but generational attitudes to shopping will require retailers to have a clear and consistent multi-channel customer service strategy in place as customers expect retailers to be prepared with the same levels of customer service during peak shopping season as during quieter times.
As customer interactions escalate during this busy period, it’s shocking that some retailers are still caught off-guard as shoppers hold off until the last minute still expecting to experience good customer service. How is your ‘bricks and clicks’ strategy, that will allow consumers to browse, buy and self-serve, using the most convenient channel for them, right up to the last minute dash? Login or Register to comment This blog Does your customer service strategy scare customers away?
2015 has arrived in all its glory and Christmas ... well the ghost of Christmas past haunts us on the third Monday in January, sending monetary chills ups our spines, making us feel blue.
However for retailers, a ghost story, far more terrifying haunts all corners of retail at this time of the year. A recent study by retail giant, John Lewis revealed that us Britons don’t care what ghostly hour it is, as online shopping sees a 30% rise between midnight and 6am. As these connected consumers expect to search, shop and self-serve online over channels of their choice, how can retailers make sure that there customer service strategy doesn’t turn into a nightmare in the lead up to the holiday season?
It’s no fairy tale today that the world as we know it is more connected than ever especially through mobile technologies. With more than 40% of online adults being multi-device users and over 70% of the UK population now owning a smartphone, consumers are increasingly turning to online channels to contact an organisation to resolve a customer service issue.
Chillingly, figures show that response rates and times to questions sent via e-mail or posted on social channels are proving disappointing, having a significant effect on customer satisfaction levels.
Twitter Over 1.5 million direct questions go unanswered (Source: socialbakers) Average question response time is 9 hours (Source: socialbakers) 20% of users posts mentioning brand accounts are questions (Source: socialbakers) Only 32% of brands have a dedicated customer service handle (Source: Simply Measured)
E -mail 59% of organisations take more than 8 hours to provide a response to e-mail enquiries (Source: Kana)
Facebook Only 65% of questions are responded to by brands on Facebook (Source: socialbakers) 25% of user posts on Facebook pages are questions (Source: socialbakers)

Time to get your mobile customer service skeleton out of the closet With a large percentage of posts on social media being questions, it makes sense to give customers the opportunity to self-serve answers to the most commonly asked questions themselves online, rather than keeping them in a perpetual state of hold.
Based on true events An intuitive FAQ search tool or live chat via a tab on a company Facebook page, website (optimised for mobile) or during an e-mail or contact form enquiry, has been the key for many leading organisations to not only reduce their level of in-bound enquiries but more importantly to resolve the majority of customer enquiries quickly and efficiently.
Disturbing? Boo to those who think web self service is a second rate customer support channel, especially during the witching hour ..."

"Tech How to Measure Social Media Success for Your Business
As a small business owner, you may be reluctant to invest in social media marketing campaigns solely because you aren’t sure how you to measure social media ROI. There are so many different ways you could measure your social media marketing success to really figure out which platforms are working for your brand.
By following the tips and tricks below, you can start making social media really work for your business. Determine Your Goals
When thinking about creating a social media campaign, you must first decide what you want to achieve from it. Are you looking to create brand awareness, better sales figures, or increase traffic to your website? Once you have this down, you can begin to start creating your campaign with this in mind. Use Goal-Driven Metrics
Once you have your goals, you’ll need to know how to measure them. If you’re looking to increase brand awareness, then you may want to measure engagement. If it’s increased sales you want, then the visitor-to-customer conversion rate may be more suitable. Simply measuring the amount of “likes” or retweets you receive may not be enough. Remember the Close Relationship Between Social Marketing And PR
These days social marketing and PR are slowly morphing together. Any company with a Facebook page or Twitter account now has a direct line to its customer base. While it may seem like too much work to maintain these accounts, it’s been suggested companies consider the COI , or cost of ignoring, social media. Use Google Analytics
If you’re monitoring the traffic coming to your website, a good way of doing so would be with Google Analytics. With the program installed on your website, you can visit the site and track exactly where your visitors are coming from, whether it’s from Google searches or your Facebook page. This gives you concrete numbers to work with. Try Call Tracking
Call tracking is a simple strategy that allows you to track social media engagement, especially on Facebook. By listing different numbers on your social media pages, you can track exactly where your customers are engaging with your business. For example, 12 Keys Rehab used call tracking on Facebook and its website, like so:
By using these two different numbers, a company can track exactly where the caller visited in order to contact it, giving it concrete information on which social media sites do and don’t work. Measure Your Direct Conversions
If you deal in ecommerce, you can set up your analytics to track how many people visit your social media page before buying a specific product. That way, you can keep track of exactly how much money a site such as Facebook is helping you bring in. However, it’s worth remembering that while sales are a great byproduct of your social media presence, they aren’t the main goal. Plan for the Future
If you’re tracking your social media campaigns, take note of what does and doesn’t work. If a certain social media site isn’t working for you, concentrate less on it or drop it altogether. If one is getting good results, think about how you can build upon that presence and goodwill.
When used and monitored properly, social media can be a fantastic and relatively easy way of reaching your client base. Social media is more immediate than other forms of advertising, meaning you can instantly pick up on something that’s not working and rework it on the fly. This does also mean the margin for error can be greater, but when the campaigns are managed with care, they can be incredibly successful.

"Pinterest’s Visual Search Goes Live 2015-11-09T15:17:54+00:00 Jade Furubayashi
Today, Pinterest announced a revolutionary new feature which enables users to find items without text. The feature has been dubbed, “Visual Search,” and it’s an absolutely game-changer for users and brands alike. Here’s how this brand new feature is being described by Pinterest :
Sometimes you spot something you really love on Pinterest, but you don’t know how to find it in real life, or what it’s even called…Well, now we’ve got a new tool that lets you find all those things you don’t have the words to describe.
This year, the introduction of Buyable Pins made Pinterest the go-to social network for eCommerce-inclined B2C brands — visual search will only cement that.
However, we have seen “Visual Search” kicked out of the nest before, by Urban Outfitters or Amazon’s Fire smartphone. How did visual search come to be? What does this mean for brands on Pinterest? What can you expect as a user? Let’s explore. The History of Visual Search
Over the past couple years, we’ve seen a handful of brands take a whack at visual search. Urban Outfitters recently signed a contract with Slyce Inc., a sophisticated visual search technology tool, to power visual search for mobile.
We also saw Amazon attempt to take visual search to the mainstream with their Fire smartphone. The feature essentially turned the world of Amazon.com into a “showroom.”
Pinterest, being one of the leading visual consumer sites, has stepped up to the visual search plate and hopes to do it better. Pinterest has already indexed a billion images on its network with the help of Berkley Vision and Learning Center. This visual recognition feature utilizes “ deep learning ” technology, which essentially teaches “computers to recognize correlations in vast data sets in order to categorize them.” The Insane Momentum of Pinterest
Pinterest’ momentum is nearly impossible to keep up with.
In March, Pinterest joined the 11-digit startup club, receiving a valuation of $11B. Shortly after, Pinterest debuted their “Buyable Pin” feature and, after only three months, the number of items “pinners” can buy doubled from 30 million to 60 million. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, in September, Pinterest crossed the 100M monthly active user milestone. Now that’s a stat line. Visual search went live today, so it’s clear that Pinterest isn’t slowing up. How Pinterest’s Visual Search Works
The tool is extremely simple. When an object catches your attention, you simply select the search tool and draw a box around it.
If it’s in Pinterest’s database, it’ll show you the name and where to find it, then let you buy it directly from retailers like Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Macy’s, if available. Pretty cool, right? Why Brands Should Take Notice
As far as social media goes, Pinterest is a dominant eCommerce force. Pinterest is revolutionizing the monetization of social media and visual search is only another reason why B2C brands would be wise to dive in ASAP.
A new method of search means more visibility opportunities for your brand and products! Make sure you’re pinning often and creating dedicated boards with wide reach . In addition, try running a contest or promotion that encourages people to utilize the new visual search! This feature seems ripe with opportunity for an epic scavenger hunt.
What do you think about Pinterest’s visual search? Will you utilize the new feature? How will this change your user experience?

At 1k points? Drop the shield eternal and storm shield, take the burning blade instead. You also don't need the gorgons chain at 1k points.
With the points saved, you should be able to swap the tacticals to bikes, give them power lance sargents and melta bombs, then left over points is melta bombs on IC's first, then other stuff.
Otherwise looks great, nice theme. Would love to do it myself sometime.

How? You simply measure the front ranks properly and then move everything up in formation. How else can a man get 150+ guardsmen up the field in under 5 minutes?"
I know this will get buried, as I'm late to the comments, but oh well here goes. I started with nothing. I still have virtually nothing. But I'm going to be a multi-millionaires and hopefully billionaire in the next decade. Why? Because I work 12 hours per day every day doing things others *don't* do. Everyone's answer to that statement is almost always, "I work that hard too but I'm not going to make that much!". You can't simply measure *hard work* by hours. You must separate yourself from the pack. Stop selling your soul to the grind and working for other people. Learn what other people don't know and become an expert. Be a visionary, an entrepreneur, a creative mind. That's how you move up in the world now. The issue isn't *wealth inequality*, the issue isn't *this country*. The issue is the internet. Every day since the inception of the internet we are a more and more connected planet. You aren't competing versus your group of coworkers anymore. You aren't even competing against your town or city anymore. Everyone is competing against everyone. If you want to be somebody you have to be *different*. Out with the old in with the new. If you can't hack it get out of the way.

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

"Quote: from: Dionna on Today at 02:37 AM A.S., you should write a summary about the study, and interview the author for the SCBWI Bulletin.
Okay. The first part was (kinda) straightforward, but the interview(s) might take a little longer.
It should be noted these none of this has anything to do with writing to formula!

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

"Previous 25 Ways to Get Highly Engaged Instagram Followers
Here at the Coaching Blog- one of the world’s leading blogs on the subject of Leadership and Coaching we quite often post articles by leading authors and authorities- today we are delighted to post an article from Brandon Gaille.
With all of the changes to the Facebook news feed algorithm, businesses are now focusing on building their Instagram followers and engagement. I am going to lay out the 25 techniques, used by Instagram pros, that will help you get tens of thousands of highly engaged followers. These followers will like, comment, and even sign up to your email list.
Are you ready to become an Instagram master? Let’s get right into the meat of it. #1 Post Daily to Build a Residual Base of Engagement
In order to gain a true following on Instagram, it is absolutely vital that you post on a normal basis. Try to post at least once a day, but more than this is always good too. I post five times everyday. Overtime, this creates a base of residual engagement and new followers.
A study by L2 found that big brands increased their average posting frequency to 9.3 posts per week in Q4 of 2014, which is up from 7.5 posts per week in Q4 of 2013. #2 Know What Times The Majority Of Your Followers Are Active And Take Advantage
The time that you post your content is crucial. You need to know when the majority of your followers are online and active, because if you post while no one is there, then no one will see it. Identify the 3-5 peaks during the day to create your posting schedule around.
If you want to take this a step further, then you can have time specific images and quotes. For example, I often post a quote in the morning about seizing the day. It hits them at the right moment with exactly what they need. #3 Interact With Your Followers And Other Users To Inspire More Engagement
It is important to regularly interact and communicate with your followers for many reasons. By responding to comments and mentions, you inspire even more people to chime in and interact. It lets your followers and potential followers see a personality behind your account. #4 Create Branded Hashtags And Monitor Their Use
Hashtags rule the Instagram world. Instead of just using popular hashtags in your posts, create your own for your brand. You will then be able to monitor how people use this hashtag. Although you do not have to be a big brand like Starbucks, we can all learn from how they use custom branded hashtags below. #5 Know What Type Of Posts Your Followers Enjoy And Use Them
Be sure to do your research about the industry you are targeting and the types of posts that are the most popular. You will likely see a pattern of layouts and content. Use these to up the interest for your account.
My target audience is entrepreneurs, and I knew that Foundr Magazine was killing it on Instagram. After studying their most shared posts, it was clear that lifestyle and powerful animal images paired with a quote received the most engagement. #6 Keep Up With Trending Hashtags In Order To Stay Relevant
On Instagram you have the ability to see which hashtags are trending and growing the fastest. You can create custom posts to piggyback on these trending tags. This can drive a burst of engagement to your post and create a new batch of followers. #7 Integrate A Webpage Call To Action With Strategic Photos For Better Conversion Rates
If you are posting five times a day, then I suggest promoting a webpage for every 20 non-promotional posts. Use short links to create custom URL’s that link directly to your a blog post or a landing page with a lead magnet.
The image should promote the key benefit and direct them to the link in the caption below the image. Use a unique bit.ly link or custom url shortener each time to keep track of total clicks so that you can identify the posts that perform the best. #8 Incorporate Video Posts To Keep It Interesting
Instagram gives you the ability to post both pictures and videos, and you should. By mixing up the types of things you post, your page will be more interesting. Videos also inspire more engagement than other types of content normally do.
Your videos can be 3 to 15 seconds long. Make it interesting. Do not just rant about something from your phone. Try and create a process that can be scaled out and utilized frequently. For example, you can use slideshows to create a set of tips or quotes.
Simply Measured conducted a study on how the top 100 brands are using video on Instagram and Vine. They found that Instagram videos had twice the engagement as Instagram photos, and Vine did not even come close to overall Instagram video engagement. #9 Have Fun And Your Followers Will Notice
Social media sites aren’t all about marketing, it’s important to have fun too. Comment and like on other users photos, follow people you like, and post things that you find entertaining. Your followers will take notice and enjoy your presence even more.
Be sure to use videos and photos to show your personality. Every holiday get dressed up and post a picture of you doing something funny. From Valentine’s Day to Christmas, the possibilities are endless. # 10 Save Time And Energy By Using Curating Posts From Other Sources
It can save you quite a bit of precious time by curating content from other places. You can easily do this with Instagram. Identify the tags related to your target audience and start browsing for images that are awesome. Take screenshots of every post that you find.
You will be left with a never ending supply of images to post to your Instagram account. Just be sure to give a mention to the person who originally posted the image in your caption. #11 Organize A Contest To Boost Followers
Contests are wildly popular on social media sites, especially Instagram. The way that these are typically done is by instructing your followers to post a certain photo and tag you in it to enter. This will then cause a chain reaction of people following you and posting the photo, which is a powerful form of promotion. #12 Connect Instagram To Your Other Social Media Accounts To Intrigue Other Followers
It isn’t uncommon for the people that follow you on Facebook or Twitter to not be following you on Instagram. This doesn’t mean that they aren’t interested in what you are posting, in fact they are probably very interested. Keep them in the loop, and possibly even bring them over to Instagram, by linking up your Instagram posts to your other social media accounts. #13 Examine What Posts Are Doing The Best And Why
It is important to keep a watchful eye on all of your posts. Examine how well they are doing, how many likes and comments they receive, and then determine why. Once you figure out what works best, implement it into the rest of your postings. #14 Adapt Instagram Exclusives To Provide Incentives
You can offer up some great deals that are only available to your Instagram followers. This will have multiple affects for both your account and your business. It can drive business and purchases, as well as give people a great incentive to follow you. #15 Team Up With Other Users For Shout Outs
Shout outs are a great way to build a relationship with another business or person, while simultaneously promoting your own. This works by posting a promotion for the other person to your followers, while the other person does the same for you.
Be wary of paying for shout outs. Most paid shout outs are a waste of good money. Focus your efforts on organic shout for shouts.
A creative way to get shout outs and build leads is to give away free swag in exchange for the shout out. Be sure to ask them to email you the screenshot of the shout out. #16 Engage Your Followers By Spotlighting Their Participation
Show your appreciation to your following and customers by regularly showcasing them on your profile. Share picture of people with your products, or people that have submitted their own reviews of your business. This will encourage people to stay active with your brand. #17 Only Promote Your Most Valuable Content in Your Posts
You can quickly burn through your followers and kill engagement by promoting poor quality content. The best practice is to have 15-30 non-promotional posts to every promotion post.
You want to make each promotion give value to your followers. Here are a few examples of value based promotions with the best engagement on Instagram… Podcast Episode of the Week Blog Post of the Week Periscope Schedule Exclusive Instagram Discount Code #18 Use Emojis To Catch People’s Attention
Emojis are those cute little pictures of smiley faces with hearts for eyes, food, animals, and many other things. People love these, especially when it comes to social media sites. They help to draw attention to your posts and engage your followers even more.
The emojis work best in and around your call to actions. Try placing 2-3 downward pointing fingers above your url link in your bio to double your click through rate. #19 Use Seven Hashtags Per Post To Get Optimal Engagement
Hashtags are useful, especially on Instagram. However, they can quickly make or break you depending on how you use them. Make sure you only include tags that are relevant to the content you are posting and your brand.
Avoid cluttering up the post with countless hashtags, this will come off very unprofessional and gimmicky to people. Piqora studied 150,000 posts by the top 100 brands and found that posts with 7 hashtags perform the best. #20 Identify the Most Popular Hashtags Within Your Niche
Hashtags are one of the easiest ways to get your target audience to see your posts. Power users will often browse through hundreds of posts within specific hashtags. Implemented correctly, this technique can make the life of a post last up to four months.
Look for hashtags that have at least 50,000 posts. If there are lots of posts, then there will be thousands of people browsing that hashtag. Narrow you target hashtags down to 50-100 and rotate them out with each post, using seven hashtags each time. #21 Use Captions To Inspire Conversations And Increase Engagement
Each post has a caption underneath it, which you can use to provoke interaction in the comments. Ask a question, such as “what do you think about this…?”, or you can even request that your followers tag their friends who may like the post as well.
Underneath all of my picture quotes I do the following.. Restate the quote with a mention to the account that published the original curated image. Tell them to “Double tap if you agree!” The simple act of asking them to double tap increases my total likes by 40%. Ask them to “Follow me @theblogmillionaire for more great quotes like this.”
A study by Simply Measured found that having a mention in the caption increased engagement by over 63%. #22 Use An Appealing Profile Picture to Increase Engagement
The first thing people see is your profile photo. This also appears next to each and every post that you publish. If you are not a Fortune 5000 company, then you need to use the picture of a real person. Photos of faces create a perceived emotional attachment and will draw in the most new followers. #23 Monitor Location Tags When You Are At Events To Connect With People
Instagram allows you to add a location in each of your posts. If you are at big event for your industry, then be sure to include the event tag on all your posts. At this year’s Podcast Movement conference, I monitored the #PM15 hashtag the entire time. It gave me the inside scoop on where the world’s top podcasters were hanging out between the scheduled events. #24 Create a Bio that Promotes Your Best Lead Magnet to Build Your Email List
Instagram allows one linked url under the bio, and you want to make it count. Whatever url you use, make sure it has an email optin with a strong lead magnet.
I send my profile clicks to TheBlogMillionaire.com , which gives away a free guide (9 Ways to Triple Your Blog Traffic). #25 Use the Crowdfire App to Follow the Most Engaged Users of Your Competition
Crowdfire is the app that pros use to handle the engagement of their Instagram accounts. It allows you to many things, but the clear winner is a tool that allows you to follow the most engaged users of other accounts.
Just type in the account that has your ideal audience and start following about 50-60 people per hour. On average, about 10-20% will follow you back and/or take a look at your account. This can easily add 3000 quality followers to your account every month.
You are now armed with an arsenal of techniques to make your Instagram account light up like the 4th of July. Now show me some love and share this post with your friends before you go off to dominate Instagram."

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.

It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

1,000,000 Nordstrom Rack customers upgraded to first purchases at a Full Line Store and/or Nordstrom.com. I know, I know, I can hear the complaints now. "Kevin, you used to work at Nordstrom, so you are biased." The omnichannel movement is all about getting the same customer to use every channel. Why not get many customers to use many channels, independent of each other? Nordstrom Rack merchandise is not integrated with the Full Line Stores, is it? Nordstrom Rack pricing is vastly different than than pricing at a Full Line Store, isn't it? Nordstrom Rack customers are younger, while Nordstrom Full Line Store customers continue to age ... it's essentially not the same customer, is it? So if 10% to 20% of the customer files overlap, then everybody wins. Incremental purchases at an off-price channel. A fraction of the customers upgrade, and are fed into the Full Line Store channel at minimal customer acquisition cost to the Full Line Store channel. Where would Nordstrom retail growth be without Rack? In classic channel management, you have two dynamics. Makers - channels that create customers. Takers - channels that take customer created by other channels. From 1995 - 2005, cataloging created customers, the online channel was the "taker". Then, the online channel took all the customers, rendering cataloging a niche marketing channel tailored to customers age 60-89. From 2002 - 2012, the online channel created customers (after taking them from catalogers, no less), then the retail channel was the "taker". This led to the theory that channels had to integrate, so that the online researcher would purchase in a store. From 2012 - 2015, the dynamic reversed - you've seen this, too, you measure this stuff, right? Right?! Once the online channel reached a sufficient level of maturity and service potential, the dynamic reversed - the retail channel created customers, the online channel reverted back to taking customers from retail. This dynamic is really, really bad for retail, because the dynamic doesn't allow for comp store sales growth as customers are slowly taken by the online channel, causing fixed costs to de-leverage (i.e. causing finance folks to need to close stores). From 2012 - 2015, e-commerce was the maker, creating customers. Mobile was the taker, taking customers cultivated by e-commerce and converting them to the newer channel. Again, we're all going to misinterpret this - we'll say we must integrate the e-commerce and mobile experience. That's a mis-read of a classic channel shift dynamic that we've observed for twenty years (catalogs vs. e-commerce) and failed to understand. Remember when everybody grumbled that mobile conversion rates were horrible? That's a complete mis-read of a shift in channel dynamics ... same thing happened when e-commerce conversion rates were 2% and catalog response rates were 7% ... we were simply measuring everything wrong ... on a monthly basis, response was comparable. In mobile, the best customers, the obsessive browsers, converted quickly (low conversion rates), and were measured poorly. Channel dynamics are not constant. They continually evolve. They must be measured. Must be. If we listen to pundits and don't perform our own due diligence, we'll simply be at the mercy of vendors selling solutions. Times are changing. We need to create businesses where channels feed each other, constantly supplying new customers into the ecosystem, new customers that are then migrated along or are kept within a portion of the ecosystem.

"BizReport : Mobile Marketing : October 14, 2015 Mobile Roundup: Growing mobile scale In today's mobile roundup, one new report indicates growing scale for mobile brands, and two releases to help mobile brands connect.
by Kristina Knight
First, AppLift has launched AppLift Labs. The new offering is an internal task force set up to help with mobile user acquisition and mobile engagement.
""Mobile marketing is one of the fastest-growing industries in the history of technology and it is incumbent upon established companies such as AppLift to keep the pace and continue to lead innovation by seizing new opportunities,"" said Vaibhav Gupta, AppLift's Chief Innovation Officer. ""AppLift Labs will provide a dedicated, supportive environment in which the most entrepreneurial-minded and innovative ad tech professionals can tackle our industry's key challenges.""
Meanwhile AerServ reports their in-app mobile video sales have increased by 300% (YoY); much of the growth can be linked to AerServ's partnerships with PubMatic, Smaato and AppNexus.
""We've seen tremendous growth in sales over the past year, and demand for our inventory is only increasing"" commented AerServ CEO Josh Speyer. ""Advertisers are realizing that mobile video, and specifically in-app mobile video, is one of the most effective ways to engage with consumers. Through strategic integrations with industry leaders, we have continued to grow the number of buyers we are able to offer publishers across mobile video.""
And SimplyMeasured has acquired DataRank; this is the second acquisition by SimplyMeasured in the past two months. The move will solidify SimplyMeasured's data capabilities. DataRank is a social intelligence firm.
""The main struggle for marketers today is how to find, understand and leverage data to improve campaign performance for their brand,"" stated Simply Measured CEO, Adam Schoenfeld. ""Basing campaign decisions on passive listening and vanity metrics is no longer enough to show social ROI or justify the investment to CMOs. Marketers need real social intelligence and research to discover new opportunities, understand online conversation, and take action. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we're providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success.""

So, if you can't do it by looking at the same game on multiple platforms, how would you go about measuring this claim? The reason I argue so vehemently against your position is that I simply don't believe that arguing on the basis of the relative prestige of whoever made a statement has much merit, especially not if there is objective data available instead. Sure, such data may not be perfect, but dismissing it out of hand seems like throwing away your best chance to make a reasoned assessment. Basically, the problem is this. One developer can say that they get a factor of 10 performance improvement on console compared to an equivalently specced PC. Another can say they see less than 2% improvement. Both can very well be right. At the same time. Maybe the former is looking at a draw-call limited scenario and comparing DX9 code on PC to very low level code on console. And the other is simply measuring the time it takes for his main deferred shading pixel shader to run. And that's the true issue with the "2x" quote and its ilk: it's simply not specific enough to be of any value. It doesn't reduce down to a "truth" or a "lie" as you would seem to believe. Because of this ambiguity, these quotes are dragged out in every argument, regardless of their applicability to the scenario, component or bottleneck being discussed. What you get then is a simple appeal to authority, and discussions that go in circles and never get to the actual issues. I hope this clarifies things.

I don't think I have any real gaming regrets recently. Kinect Sports Rivals is probably the closest I have to one, as I've not had my living space set up to use it much. Or they're simply measuring by a different metric. Out of all the games he listed, only one actually required a PS4 to play. The PS4 obviously doesn't have no games from a factual point of view, but it's pretty easy for a multiplatform owner to feel like there's very little for them to play on it. The 360 used to face similar comments for a similar reason (without even having endless crossgen releases to worry about). I've had one since near launch, so we can rule that out.

"AcclaimedMusic.net Like us on Facebook
By day, Henrik Franzon is a tax agent in Stockholm, working for the Swedish equivalent of the IRS. In his off hours, the statistician uses his skills to sort through a much hipper set of data. It could be argued that more than anyone at Pitchfork or Rolling Stone or NME , this bureaucrat is the ultimate oracle of just how respectable your musical tastes are.
Franzon collects music critics’ lists the way botanists collect seeds. Some are lists of the best songs or albums ever. Others are parsed by genre or country or era. He draws them from magazines, the ever-expanding online music press, and a few books. Using a complex algorithm, he has aggregated these to create massive lists of the most acclaimed albums, songs, and artists of all time. Since 2003, the continually updated results have been published on his website, AcclaimedMusic.net . Right now, the site contains ranked lists of the 1,000 artists , 3,000 albums , and 6,000 songs most beloved to music writers around the globe.
He admits his hobby is odd. “When I showed [my first aggregated list] to my friends, they thought I was insane,” Franzon recalls. But as a lover of both music and statistics, he kept refining his formula and collecting and inputting lists. “I like to work with this kind of data,” he says. “There’s no right or wrong,” as to which music is actually best, “which makes it different than other statistics.”
Franzon, 42, grew up on acts like Depeche Mode and The Cure during the blossoming of the print-media music press. He says he’s been interested in these lists since a retrospective on the best albums of all time in a Swedish music magazine expanded his tastes.
His aggregate rankings don’t simply measure the number of times a song or album winds up on a list. “There are a lot of parameters,” says Franzon. All-time lists count for more than more limited lists, like year-end round-ups or lists ranking the best of a genre. Lists representing the view of a publication or institution (like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll ) count for more than lists of an individual critic (like Greil Marcus’ book The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll in Ten Songs ). Lists that come from a place that doesn’t produce a lot of lists (i.e., outside the critics’ bubbles of New York and London) get more weight. But lists that contain a bunch of picks not usually on such lists get less weight, as a guard against deliberately provocative musical musings. Newer lists count for more than older lists. A song or album’s place on a ranked list is factored in. The algorithm also incorporates ratings from sites like AllMusic and Metacritic.
To put it succinctly, Franzon gathers up critical accolades, factors in a few parameters to steer the results towards reflecting global critical opinion of the best of the best, and then crunches the numbers. AcclaimedMusic.net provides his footnotes. Click on an item and you’ll see which lists it’s on.
By design, the top results won’t surprise vinyl geeks quick to click such lists whenever they’re published by the likes of Rolling Stone .

PLZ PLZ PLEASE READ, IT WILL BENEFIT OR ATLEAST REINFORCE KEY THINGS ON SKINCARE; NO MATTER IF UR INTERESTED IN THIS PRODUCT OR NOT. Again, THIS IS NOT A REVIEW of the Regenerist serum (yet) but a clarification. So after reading manyy of the top reviews on this product particularly; I realized alot of people are using it incorrectly & common myths on skincare exist in general. (1) For starters, this is a serum, not a moisturizer, it will do nothing for giving hydration to your skin, instead it deposits nutrients. If you have oily skin & this adds sufficient moisture-great; however if you have normal/dry/need SPF you will most likely need a moisturizer in conjunction. (2) And here's where most people get it wrong, this & any serum for the fact is always used BEFORE the moisturizer.Read the box. (If you use a toner then its-wash, toner, serum then moisturizer) Serums are targeted for deeper layers of skin & contain smaller molecules that must penetrate & absorb in (usually takes 5 mins) to give its full benefits. (3) So although, this has dimethicone and gives that silky silicone smooth texture to skin, it doesn't really double up as a primer for makeup--unless your RE-applying it after the moisturizer OR using at night so no need of spf OR have oily skin so this is your moisturizer (for which I'm assuming/hoping your makeup has substantial spf). (4) Lastly, another major misconception, SPF's do NOT combine. So using SPF15 moisturizer + SPF25 foundation does NOT=SPF40. **Additionally, the higher spf (in this case the foundation) is NOT the protection you get, the protection you do get is ONLY of the FIRST SPF containing product you put on your face--ALWAYS. That's why a moisturizer WITH spf is essential--because you need to generously apply ALL over your face, not just problem areas & then whats in your makeup does not give any extra blockage really---unless you skip straight to foundation & happen to cover every pore on your face. Ofcourse spf is important ALL year round & the #s don't change the ingredients or make it more potent, it simply measures time--how long it takes to burn in the sun. Therefore, in a sense SPF 15 is enough for even the palest but because people don't apply as much or re-apply as is needed to be efficient, spf 30 is recommended by most dermatologists FYI--Im a medical student but more importantly a serious devotee to taking good prevention steps & care of my skin. Also, I have only used this serum for a month so cannot give a complete review on the product yet. So far so good though, will update later.

I'll bite. Last year I was working for a course, and ended up playing about 5 rounds a week, with the group of guys I got to know really well. Typical course regulars, all very active in our mens league. One of our buddies is the president of a professional sports team, who would sponsor numerous tournaments all over our area and put us on his team to play. We were already at an advantage playing the course very often. This particular tournament that we played (for charity - don't remember the cause) offered mulligans and licorice ropes. My friend wanted to make a "charitable contribution" to this organization, and purchased one mulligan per hole (max, per team) and one licorice rope per player (max, per tournament) If you haven't seen the licorice rule before, if you hit your ball within the length of your one licorice rope, to the hole - you simply measure off the amount of distance, tear off the amount of licorice you measured, eat your licorice and count it as a made putt/chip. Our group usually played from the tips, and this tournament was played from the whites. I know I'll get flamed, and we all felt stupid for even turning in our score due to the comparison to the other teams there (there were some good teams, too) - Keep in mind that this score is utilizing all of these "extras". We ended up with birdies on all of the par 3's, 2 eagles on par 4's - the rest birdies, eagles on all the par 5's. Total score was 48 on a par 72 course. -24. The closest score that day was -18 = 54.   This charity knew that people tend to get pencil-whipped at 4-man scrambles, so their prizes for placing in the top 3 weren't anything special. Our team won all longest drives, and closest to the pin contests, with witnesses.   Everyone on our team has made birdie or better on every hole at this course, during regular play.

"Welcome, Kathy.
1. Please read the installation instructions for the Hardibacker you plan to use to be sure you're not missing other things. James Hardie, like all other manufacturer of CBUs, recommends his thinner panels for floor use unless you simply want additional height.
As for installing over the sheet flooring you have, I don't know that James Hardie recommends that, but we commonly tell visitors that so long as the vinyl is not cushioned, that installation method is probably OK. See my warranty information below.
2. If your sawn board subflooring is at least 3/4"" thick, and if that plywood is more than nominal half-inch, you should be OK. The industry requires a minimum of nominal half-inch plywood over sawn board subflooring, but that presumes the boards to be of T&G style and oriented perpendicular to the joists. You don't appear to have either.
3. It is relatively to determine the unsupported span of your joists and you should do that. You need to know nothing more than what is holding up each end of the joist and if you have access from below you can simply measure that span.
The very little bit of joist we can see in your photo indicates to me they are of relatively low grade. Can't really tell anything more about them without substantially more visibility. And even then we're all just guessing.
My opinion; worth price charged."

for what it's worth, the resistance of the coil matters very little when you're controlling the wattage digitally. The electronics simply measure the resistance, then alter the voltage to produce the desired wattage. for a given wattage, a 1 ohm coil will burn just like a 2 ohm coil (or anything in between), just at different voltages. For example, at 15 watts, a 1.5 ohm coil will cause the vreg to raise the output voltage to 4.75ish. a 2 ohm coil would run at 5.5v. a 1 ohm would be 3.9v. the real differences in the different builds would be surface area and lag time in reaching max heat. that's a lot more about the gauge of wire, not the resistance although the two do go hand-in-hand in some respects.

"Are You Targeting the Right Audience on Social Media?
“Hey, pay attention to us! No…wait, you’re not buying our product. Um…how about YOU?”
Does this confusion remind you a bit of seeking out your audience on social? It’s tricky. Location, gender, favorite network, hottest hashtag, other hobbies, following your competitors — what’s the magic formula for your ideal fan?

Source: SimplyMeasured.com/are-you-targeting-the-right-audience-on-social-m... Social Campaign Checklist
Well, you know what all we Data Geeks from Dataville are going to say: Bust out the analysis! If you’ve been doing any social media marketing you have data to work with and can sort through it for audience-defining gems of all kinds.

Here are five, must-use analyses that will get you moving in the right direction quickly. 1. Twitter Profile Keyword Analysis
Why: There are already people following you. What are they into? They’ll let you know with their Twitter bios. You get demographic data like hometown, career (#techpreneur), hobbies, alma mater, gender, values (#Belieber), and more.
Your job is to look for patterns. And, whittle your findings down to a list of words that appear most often in people who take the actions you seek: click through to your website, download your content, retweet your posts, mention you in their posts, and (ftw!) buy your product.
How To: You can download information about your followers from Twitter into Excel and find sort, organize, and tally up words. Create a list of the most common words in your existing followers’ bios. Then, see if you can connect certain words with people who engage more, like those most likely to reply, retweet or mention you. This chart from the Simply Measured Twitter Audience Analysis shows the most common keywords in Twitter bios of followers for a brand. 2. Competitors’ Followers’ Keywords
Why: You want people to buy your product, not your competitors’. You won’t be able to download your competitor’s Twitter follower list with bios, but you can take a general look around at their followers’ qualities and find keyword similarities and differences from your current list.
Ideally, you’ll discover a segment you didn’t know you should be targeting. For example, maybe you’re a yoga studio owner and you find that a studio near you offers acupuncture and a lot of their followers are responding to deals they’re posting, or they list “acupuncture” in their bio.
Maybe you can offer some alternative medical treatments in your space, as well, or team up with a local practitioner as a co-marketer.
How To: The key here is to take an organized approach to each competitor’s followers. Look at their most engaged and active followers to start. How do their bios keywords, attitude and interests compare to yours?
Look, especially, for variations on the theme, such as an age group or geographic location you could target with special promotions or paid ads. Try to do this analysis at least once a month so you’re keeping an eye on the scene and what’s changed. This chart comparing audience size over time for eight different brands is from the Simply Measured Twitter Competitive Analysis. 3. Your Most Active Followers
Why: Some people decided to follow your brand then took a really long nap…never to appear on Twitter again. Don’t despair! You can use the data provided by Twitter to find out which of your followers is wide awake and actively engaged with your brand. These people are way more likely to enjoy any promotions you send out, share you content, and grow your following. This Audience Distribution chart tells you what percent of your audience is most actively engaged on Twitter.
How To: Sort through your follower data by “Date of Last Tweet.” Study these followers’ other qualities and look for similarities – hashtags they most often use, when they’re most active, what time zones they are in, if they’re saying positive or negative things about your brand, or whatever else you would like to know.
Also, sort these folks by the size of their audience and pay extra attention to those with the biggest following. These are your most high-impact fans. 4. Who Is Mentioning You?
Why: Keyword analysis of people’s interests helps you find unexpected connections between your brand and other hobbies or interests. But, what about people who are straight up talking about YOU?
Scour Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for mentions of your brand and, again, pay attention to these folks – social habits, demographics, friend groups you could reach out to, and more.
How To: Gather up mention data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Organize it and dig through it in Excel. You can do many different analyses. Look for any of the following: Positive or negative sentiment"

Fanglo - I was not directing my post at you. I respect the insight you provided. Jocke threw in the comment about bolts. Having said that, all I care about right now is the actual archery miss rate, not the cause. Until I see mythic admit that they used the bolt code, and I have clear data that the archery miss rates have gone up 3x vs pre patch, I intend to state those facts. That miss rates may be a function of how many attackers are on a target is not germane to the observation that miss rates, under real rvr conditions have tripled. I'd like to see a response from Mythic on that or disclosure that they cut and pasted the bolt code and that archers will need to live with these miss rates. I've provided the logs to Mythic that show miss rates under real conditions, not artificial ones. Those are the only conditions I care about. They are repeatable, given a sufficient sample size (I submitted over 1000 arrow shots in real rvr) to show the miss rates under actual conditions. At this point, I have no use for miss rates under artificial conditions, because I am not establishing cause and effect relationships. I am simply measuring miss rates in real rvr. Your logs are valuable to discern cause and effect relationships, but I am unwilling to accept that I can only use my bow as a single attacker in rvr in order to get acceptable miss rates.

@nsmitha @ginovalente @simplymeasured We do have Madden 15!
by: earsplittingdep14 If you've wanted to start woodworking for some time, you've probably already put a lot of thought into it. Woodworking is not that hard, but there are some things you should know before you get started. Keep reading to learn more about woodworking.Understand a woods characteristics before you use stain on it. Wood designated as "paint grade" is lower in quality and not suitable for staining. Similarly, veneer and particle board are quite different; the former does not absorb stain well while the latter absorbs too much. It is crucial to get the perfect wood for your creation.Rulers don't like to stay in pockets, but you need them http://chinabye.com/top-tips-and-advice-about-adult-bunk-beds-furniture/ - bunk beds - to be handy! If you purchase a metal ruler, you can keep it in your pocket with a telescoping magnet. The magnet will keep the ruler safely in your pocket.You can simply fix some hinges with a golf tee if you are working on an interior door. Remove hinges and door from door frame and lightly tap one golf tee inside each of the screw holes. Cut the golf tee off flush with the surface and put the door back on the hinges. The screw will be able to then hold on to the golf tee in order to function properly.You want to be sure that you have the right size nails for your project. Very large nails typically cause the wood to split, which will prevent it from holding well. Alternatively, nails that are tool small fail to hold the joint. It's important to be able to match the correct size of nail for each job.Always look for free wood around your neighborhood. A lot of businesses don't need to use their pallets anymore, and might let you take them if you've got a means to do so. Look online for ideas of what you can make with pallets.Your work area must be well lit. This will helps you make accurate measurements. Also, sharp tools are used to do the wood cutting. These activities mean that you must see properly to avoid mistakes and injury.When you use the table saw, be safe. While crosscutting, it is important that you use a block properly secured on the fence when establishing the cut length. This helps prevent boards from springing back. When you use a clamp, the end of the board is still available to be cut.Try a woodworking kit or two. These kits will come with wood that is pre-cut that you need to start putting together to make your project. This is a good way to begin this hobby. This will save money too because you won't make as many mistakes.There always comes a time that something will fly into your eye when you least expect it. So, never turn a mental blind eye towards wearing your goggles, or you might just wind up with a real one. Make sure that your goggles fit properly.Be sure to measure twice. You may even consider taking the time to measure as many as three times before you cut if the materials you are using are expensive. Most mistakes can be avoided by simply measuring twice. If you happen to cut an expensive piece of wood too short, you have likely wasted that piece, unless it can be used somewhere else.Some power tools are essential for woodworking projects. You need a jigsaw, a circular saw, a power sander, a small table saw, and an adequate drill or driver. Ideally, you want an orbital sander, but you can still work with a regular power sander.Spend some time on watching woodworking programs on TV. They are full of useful information and provide great ideas about projects you may not have thought of. Look through the TV listings to find shows like this.Budget for each project. Sit down once you've got a project in mind, and determine the realistic costs. Know exactly what you're going to need and how much it costs. It's never good to misjudge costs to the point where you need to drop a project.Woodworking is an art form, make no mistake. This article has shown you something new. Get out there and start creating you own pieces of art. Woodworking is very satisfying for many. You won't know if you can do it until you give it a try.

Really? I wasn't implying the idea that "Oh if you enjoy it then it's a good game." There are plenty of games that I enjoy that are total suck. But I feel people go too far. I deal with this sort of thing all the time on the Final Fantasy boards, where many fans are as fickle as can possibly be. One mistake and Square is suddenly worse than Activision. But ten seconds later they're 'teh shizz' again. If you genuinely enjoyed an experience, you shouldn't treat it like dirt. And unfortunately, a lot of people treat ME3 like dirt, and often (as the initial post suggest) the whole series. Why? That's hypocritical and stupid. @mazariamonti Well, by game feel I meant how it controls; that's what game feel means. It's smooth, easily controllable, doesn't fight you, and feels good to play. It's intuitive and has controls that quickly become second nature. That's great game feel. As for everything else, you basically drove my point home. As I said, it may not be as good as some other top-notch titles. But that's like saying that the Farrari 458 isn't as good as the Lamborghini Aventador or the Bugatti Veyron. That may be true, but it's still a fricking supercar; it's still better than most anything you throw against it on a track. ME3 is -as you yourself said- a AAA title. AAA isn't simply measured by popularity, but by an extremely high minimum quality rating. It means that, even if it's not the best AAA title, it's almost guaranteed to be better in most ways than titles measured by lower standards. I get that ME3's shortcoming hurt more because it is a AAA title. It was supposed to be a behemoth that demolished all of our expectations of worlds, characters and storytelling in gaming. And it wasn't. But it being a 'mediocre AAA title' does not make it a mediocre game in general. When compared to your average game, it was still a better game. I dunno, maybe you've just never played a legitimately mediocre game, like Crackdown, or Fable. And maybe you've never played a truly bad game, like Sonic 06, DBZ: Kinnect, or Last Rebellion. Regardless, Mass Effect 3 wasn't a bad game, or even a mediocre game outside of its upper eschelon peers. When looking at games as a whole, it was a great game... With probably the most rushed and crappy ending this side of Halo 2. But that's only part of the story; a part many other people blow out of proportion.

For those of you who have some in storage and don't use them, do you cycle them, leave them be, run a break in, discharge then re-charge, just charge, etc?
I have a bunch that have been storage for exactly 2 years now. When I first got them, I did a break in cycle on a MAHA C-9000 charger and put them away. Since I read that they will hold about 70% capacity after 3 years, 85% after 1, I decided to look in after 2 years, just to see.
Since I can't determine the current capacity of the battery that is left, unless I run a cycle on the MAHA, I simply measured volts on my Fluke and they were a little lower than when they were stowed, from around 1.450v down to 1.318v, across the board, after two years.
I also read, as a rule of thumb, that an Eneloop at 1.2v is discharged, at 1.28v is half charged or better, at 1.35v is mostly full. So as far as ""volts"" goes and the ""rule of thumb"", they still seem to be in a decent state of charge.
Since I haven't been able to find any definite doc's on the web about how to treat Eneloops after years of storage, I decided to run 2 sets of 4 through the
C9000's, one set on discharge, (to be recharged) to simulate a cycle and the other on break in (since that's what's the guy at MAHA told me to do today, that might not have been the best advice, but whatever). Seems to me the refresh/analyze mode, or cycle, or just charge mode would have been a better way to go.
So, anyone have any experience on storing these things long term and what to do in order to keep them reasonably fresh for when they are needed? I need to come up with some kind of service schedule here.
Thanks

If it looks right it is right. This would be my approach. What I would do is have the ball cast a ray in fixedupdate. Lets assume, 1) the ball has hit the paddle, and 2) the ball is always casting a ray out in its forward direction vector, and storing the result in RaycastHit struct. I could simply measure the distance of the ray hit (in RayCastHit) to my centre if thats less or equal to my radius then contact has been made. I could also test for collisions using the OnCollisionEnter methods as well. If a collision has taken place, then I need to calculate the new force to apply to the ball. If I look at RayCastHit and it will tell me the normal of the collision. Invert this normal and multiply this by some force constant and apply this force to the rigidbody of the ball. Experiment using Impulse and Acceleration force modes. I suspect impulse is better.

After taking an in depth class on statistics and micro and macro economics, having read Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, and at a teacher's recommendation, I was excited to pick up this book. While the novel starts off promisingly, it soon becomes a repetitive mix of "look how incredible Levitt is" by quoting the New York Times Magazine as the page separating the chapters, and constantly referring to Levitt as an individual who is rather quirky in comparison to his stuffy peers. Of course, Levitt's nature is how he connects with other semi misfits. While they continue to push the idea that there is no central, unifying theme in there book, there is the constant idea of incentives. How do people respond to incentives, and how can one manipulate incentives for a desired effect? They persuasively argue that Schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers are quite similar in the arena of cheating. School teachers secretly fudge student's test scores, in order to receive bonuses from the State for improving scores. Sumo wrestlers hold a system of quid pro quo. He ties this in with a certain bagel seller, and dissects the type of people who cheat ( those in larger companies, and especially executives) along with what causes them to cheat the bagel man ( weather, mood, high stress holidays). Real estate agents, will push to close a deal on a house as quick as possible, even if that costs the home owner thousands. The idea being that the agent will only gain a few hundred dollars, thus it is simply not worth her time to push for a higher price to sell the house for. Thus, this idea of information asymmetry is beneficial for her. For the KKK, information proved to be the downfall for the group, as a individual named Stetson Kennedy infiltrated the group, and leaked all of it's secrets. Once the group, which was shrouded in mystery, had no more secrets it could use to incite fear in others with, the group crumbled. They then delve into the structure of crack dealers, which they compare to that of a McDonald's organization. Those at the bottom, "foot soldiers" do not earn much (hence the chapter title- drug dealers living with their moms) thus they earn little, and thrive on the hope to one day become successful and move up the drug ranks. Of course, gang fights led to increased violence. But all of a sudden, crime rates began dropping. At this point, the authors delve into their sticky point that abortion is the main reason for the drop in crime rates, (if an unwanted child is born in a negative environment, he is prone to become a criminal) along side imprisonment, increase in police officers, and the bursting of the crack bubble (crack dealers undercutting and killing one another until it came to the point where selling was not worth the costs.) It'd be interesting for them to address how perhaps other methods of contraceptives like condoms, birth control pills, plan b, family planning education, may have changes the outcome of crime rates, if at all. More hard to swallow, was the final chapters on the "perfect parent". Why call it so when even the authors concede that they are merely establishing correlations between parental factors that could possibly change children's test scores? Correlation does not equate causation. Furthermore, they found their results in relation to test scores. While this is an interesting starting point, it gives the misleading impression that reading to a child, museums, spanking, television, etc. does not have a substantial change of individual's success when all other variables remain the same. Success cannot be simply measured in test scores- in an environment where a child is spanked excessively, ( where is the line between spanked and abuse?) it may be the case that his test scores are normal, but what about his health and emotional well being? The authors further imply that reading to one's child, or staying home with one's child had no correlation to higher test scores. They then conclude that parents need not be obsessive. While yes, parents should not hover, but as Gladwell had asserted in Outliers, a child growing up in a more privileged environment leads to the child feeing entitled, and more likely to pursue success. Furthermore, the child's parents are more likely to stand up for their child, and if needs be, contradict members of authority. The last few chapters seemed to deteriorate in it's quality of writing as well, and became rather repetitive. Thankfully, the epilogue cleanly wrapped up the entire book, such that it comes full circles to the beginning if the book, and concedes that there are exception to these patterns. (less)

by: manngfnpkhccwu Ed Weiler knew he was about to walk into the lion's den.It was June 27, 1990, and Weiler, the chief scientist with the Hubble Space Telescope program, was about to tell a room full of skeptical reporters that the newly launched $1.5 billion observatory's supposedly flawless 94.5-inch primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape and was unable to bring starlight to a crisp focus.Just two months earlier, to great fanfare and bold promises about the wonders Hubble would reveal, the space telescope had been launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery. Four weeks later, after working through the usual sorts of commissioning snags, a "first light" image of a nondescript star field was downlinked and proudly displayed.While superior to ground-based views, the image did not appear to be in razor-sharp focus, not unusual when it comes to fine tuning a new telescope -- not to mention on that was orbiting 360 miles up. Engineers spent days moving Hubble's secondary mirror ever so slightly, taking picture after picture and analyzing the results.To their dismay, Hubble simply could not achieve a crisp focus.Instead of bringing 70 percent of a star's light to the same focal point, the mirror could only manage 10 percent to 15 percent. Detailed analysis by increasingly concerned engineers and opticians eventually found the shape of the concave mirror, moving from the center to the outer edge, was too shallow by up to 2 microns -- a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair.Due to an oversight during fabrication, the concave shape of Hubble's primary mirror was too shallow toward its outer edges by 2 microns, a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair. As a result, starlight was not brought to a focus at the same point, resulting in blurry images. These three images show the same star as viewed from a ground-based telescope, left, and from Hubble's uncorrected mirror, center. The corrected image, after a space shuttle repair mission in 1993, is seen on the right.NASA But that was more than enough to turn the most heralded telescope ever built into a laughing stock, the butt of derisive late-night television jokes and the subject of outrage on Capitol Hill.But it was not immediately clear what the problem might be or what, if anything, could be done to fix it. Actuators attached to the back of the mirror could be adjusted to make very slight changes to its shape, but the problem appeared to go well beyond that."It was like scratching your head, how could this thing not want to focus? A temperature problem?" Weiler recalled in an interview. "At first, people thought the mirror was misshapen in the sense that it was slightly misshapen and we could take it out with the actuators. The actuators could take out a lot of bumps and valleys. The trouble was, it wasn't bumps and valleys, the entire parabola was wrong."It was, in fact, a textbook case of spherical aberration, later determined to be the result of a small, undocumented 3 mm-wide washer a technician had inserted in a device called a null corrector that was used to check the mirror's shape during its fabrication years earlier.Weiler was devastated."If you had polled all the engineers and scientists at the Cape the night before launch for the top 10 concerns they had, what could break on Hubble or what wouldn't work on Hubble, I would bet my house and a lot more than not one of them would put on their list the mirror's the wrong shape and we've got spherical aberration," he said. "Nobody worried about that, because we were assured by the optics guys that we had the most perfect mirror every ground by humans on Earth."We were in denial from May 1990 till about early June. I remember my final moment when (astronomer) Sandy Faber, at a meeting on the optical problems we were having, leaned over and said 'I'm convinced now, we have spherical aberration.' When she said that to me, I finally believed it, because I really trusted Sandy."Over the next few weeks, engineers precisely mapped the mirror's shape, discovering it had been ground just as perfectly as advertised, but to exactly the wrong shape.Ed WeilerNASA While the detective work was going on, NASA engineers scrambled to come up with possible fixes, everything from sending a spacewalking astronaut into Hubble's optical tube to replace the telescope's secondary mirror, to installing a circular shade around the opening of the tube, reducing the aperture and improving the focus by blocking out the outer regions of the primary mirror.But first, NASA had to own up to spherical aberration.As the Hubble program scientist at NASA Headquarters, Weiler was the public face of the space observatory and it fell to him to tell the world that the most expensive civilian satellite ever built was the victim of the most basic of optical errors, a defect that struck many as a sign NASA had lost its edge.He also knew it would provide ammunition to critics who worried NASA no longer had the technical competence to build its long-sought space station, the centerpiece of the agency's human space program. As Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science and Weiler's boss put it when he first learned of spherical aberration: "Space science just had its Challenger accident."The morning of the news conference to officially announce the mirror defect, Weiler attended a science working group meeting at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. It was an already scheduled meeting to review what Hubble's five primary instruments could, and could not, do with spherical aberration.There was little or no impact on Hubble's High Speed Photometer, designed to simply measure the intensity of starlight. But two light-splitting spectrographs -- one designed for faint objects and the other for high-resolution observations -- could only do about half of their planned observations. And the European Space Agency's Faint Object Camera, sensitive to ultraviolet light, was pretty much "blown out of the water," Weiler said.But the mirror's biggest impact was on the Wide Field Planetary Camera, the instrument expected to provide the dazzling visible and near-infrared images most easily understandable by the public and of tremendous value to astronomers."The real killer was Jim Westphal (the WFPC principal investigator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California), who tended to be very negative," Weiler recalled. "Basically, he said he couldn't do anything. So that's what I was preparing to walk into the press conference with."But as it turned out, Weiler had two aces up his sleeve. One he knew about, one he didn't.The ace he knew about was drawn seven years earlier, when Weiler kicked off work to build a backup camera, the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, a carbon copy of the original. John Trauger was the principal investigator, the man in charge of the instrument at JPL.The ace Weiler didn't yet realize was built into the design of Trauger's camera.John TraugerNASA Shortly after the first light image came down, "one of the grand old men of optics here at JPL, Aden Meinel, he and his wife Marjorie wanted to see what the image looked like," Trauger said in an interview. "We brought it up on the screen. ... And he looked at that for five minutes and he said 'that looks like spherical aberration.'"That was the first time I heard spherical aberration," Trauger recalled. "The thing was, he also said 'well, if it is spherical aberration, you could fix it with Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.' He knew that we had these nickel-sized mirrors in our optical system, which received a sharp image of the primary mirror itself. ... The very last mirror before the image is created on our CCD was an opportunity to straighten the wavefront out. He recognized that, too."By giving that mirror a prescription that exactly countered the spherical aberration in the primary mirror, the WFPC 2 would be able to achieve a perfect focus and do all of the science that was intended.Trauger consulted optical experts at JPL and "within a month of that realization, we had put together a convincing story. That led to what I thought was a very dramatic meeting at the end of June. Everybody got together (at Goddard) and said what have we got, what science can we do and what can we do about it? And we were extremely confident that we had not just a solution, but a solution that would be wide field, it would completely restore what we were doing."And so, during the science working group meeting at Goddard, Trauger told Weiler "you know, we think we can fix it," Weiler recalled. "I said what do you mean you think you can fix it?"Trauger explained the proposed solution and Weiler, in effect grasping a lifeline, went to the dreaded news conference, fervently hoping Trauger was right. Deputy project manager Jean Olivier told the throng of reporters that Hubble suffered from spherical aberration so perfect it likely was caused during the mirror's fabrication.Weiler told the crowd "it would be dishonest for me to say the mood of the scientists is very happy right now. We're all very frustrated. But we should be able to fix it" during the next shuttle servicing mission.But the WFPC 2 was just one instrument, albeit one of the most important from a public perception standpoint. It still wasn't clear what could be done about Hubble's other instruments -- the Faint Object Camera, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph, the Faint Object Spectrograph and the High Speed Photometer.The business end of COSTAR: Small mirrors on motorized arms directed corrected light into the Hubble Space Telescope's spectrographs and faint object camera. COSTAR and the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 were installed during a 1993 shuttle mission, correcting Hubble's flawed vision.Eric Long/Smithsonian Institution In a tale that would strain credulity in any other mission, the answer occurred to James. Crocker, a senior engineer at Ball Aerospace Corp., one morning while standing in a shower during a trip to Germany."He was looking at the European showers with the handles that flip down and all that," Weiler said. "And the idea came to him you know, we could take out the High Speed Photometer and put in a box and have a bunch of handles that come up with little mirrors that deploy and refocus the light from the telescope mirror into the two spectrographs and the FOC."Crocker brought that idea back to the United Station and by the end of 1990, the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, or COSTAR, was under contract, scheduled for launch aboard the shuttle Endeavour in 1993, along with the WFPC 2, a new set of solar arrays and other components.The servicing mission went off without a hitch, and on Dec. 18, 1993, just five days after Endeavour returned to Earth, Trauger beeped Weiler, telling him that checkout operations had gone smoothly and that first light images from WFPC 2 were expected at the Space Telescope Science Institute that night."About 50 astronomers and institute engineers were gathered around a screen and that first picture came down," Weiler recalled. "And that is the moment I knew we had fixed it. The first image had a star right in the center. It was only that star, but it was crystal sharp clear. ... People just went crazy. I think when I saw the image, I said 'holy shit!' I thought (NASA Administrator) Dan Goldin was going to fire me the next day and instead, he congratulated me."After collecting images and other data from Hubble's full suite of instruments, NASA unveiled the results to the public during a Jan. 13, 1994, news conference at Goddard that was timed to coincide with the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society in nearby Washington.Before the news briefing, Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, who famously asked whether NASA was building "techno turkeys" during a hearing in the wake of spherical aberration, joined Goldin and Weiler for a preview of before-and-after pictures from WFPC 2 and the COSTAR-assisted Faint Object Camera."She walks in the room and I had on the left side of the table 'before' images and on the right hand side of the table today's images," Weiler said. "She walked in and looked at them and her reaction was, 'my God, it's like putting my glasses on!' It was vindication. Redemption."At the news conference, she said "the trouble with Hubble is over."The $50 million COSTAR is frequently referred to as the instrument that "fixed" Hubble, but to Weiler and many other Hubble veterans, the real hero was the $23.9 million Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. While the instruments serviced by COSTAR all produced world-class science, it was the JPL camera that generated the lion's share of the big-picture science after the servicing mission. And it generated the steady stream of spectacular pictures that sparked virtually all of the public's interest."I hope before I leave this Earth I correct one misimpression," Weiler said. "The COSTAR was NOT the fix to the Hubble Space Telescope. WFPC 2 was. And I say that for a very simple reason. Go look at all the press articles and the science that came out of Hubble in 1994 and 1995."Weiler hastened to add he was not "knocking" COSTAR. The ingenious instrument, with its 10 small mirrors and motorized appendages, was an elegant solution to an extraordinarily complex problem. But in Weiler's view, it was the pictures, not the spectra, that "saved" Hubble in the eyes of the public.Astronauts work to install COSTAR in the Hubble Space Telescope..NASA Trauger's camera would end up operating for 15-and-a-half years aboard Hubble. And it was the only instrument that was still functioning when the final shuttle servicing crew showed up."With a little hubris here, in retrospect, it was still working when the servicing mission in 2009 went up to replace the camera with Wide Field Camera 3, which is a great thing," Trauger said. "Our WFPC was getting old and tired, you might say, but it was the only instrument that was working. It was doing everything for the last year or two. We all feel pretty good about that."WFPC 2 and COSTAR, which was no longer in use by that point, were removed during the 2009 servicing mission and returned to Earth. Both are now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.A version of this story originally appeared in http://astronomynow.com/" target="_blank - Astronomy Now - .2015 CBS Interactive Inc.

"The Story Behind Twitter Sensation 'Nihilist Arby's' That Every Marketer Should Read A case study on branding dark humor By Christopher Heine August 13, 2015, 2:38 PM EDT Technology Brendan Kelly has drawn a huge following by spoofing the sandwich maker. Guess what he does for a living? Brendan Kelly is the bassist and singer for Epitaph Records' punk band The Lawrence Arms , has appeared on The Daily Show , pens a fairly popular blog called Bad Sandwich Chronicles and has carved out a career as an advertising copywriter, currently working for FCB's experiential division (FCBx) in Chicago. That'd all play pretty well at a class reunion, wouldn't it? Well, there's more. Eight months ago, Kelly started a phenomenon called Nihilist Arby's, a darkly hilarious Twitter account that has attracted more than 100,000 followers. The achievement is definitely worth another paragraph or two on his Wikipedia page or—to borrow some of his fictional character's spirit— IN HIS OBITUARY, whenever his inevitable demise occurs on some sad, meaningless day . The 38-year-old chatted with Adweek about the origin of Nihilist Arby's . ""Twitter is such a great medium, but it's misunderstood, generationally,"" he explained. ""It's like an awesome newspaper where everyone can customize what they get by following certain entities, whether they want comedy, politics or naked chicks. But then you have these dumb corporations that just don't get it, you know? And fast-food brands unbelievably perpetuate the most terrible of ideas."" Kelly said he began thinking about how funny it would be if a social media manager for a restaurant chain ""just lost it, after sending out yet another tweet about something [inane] like a new dipping sauce. And I said to whoever I was speaking to at the time, 'It should be called something incredibly stupid like Nihilist Arby's.'"" Cue animated light bulb above his head—a-a-a-a-nd scene! So he launched the account in January, and Kelly's brand of absurdist, death-and-doom tweeting quickly garnered around 250 followers. ""And then one day, I sent out a tweet and went to lunch,"" he recalled. ""When I got back, I had, like, 13,000 followers. And it's just snowballed from there."" In case you were wondering, he didn't go to Arby's for lunch that day—though he's got nothing against the roast-beef slinger. In fact, when asked if the fast-food chain had contacted him, he sounded slightly disappointed that the company hadn't reached out. Maybe its marketers should. At one point this year, per data from Simply Measured, Nihilist Arby's was getting better Twitter engagement than the real Arby's. ""[It] is a great example of successfully catering content to your target audience,"" remarked Kevin Shively, Simply Measured's content marketing manager. ""[He has] capitalized off creating a witty, irreverent personality and in turn seen continued growth and increasing engagement for a parody account—something that's usually very hard to accomplish."" Bill Carter, a partner at digital agency Fuse, added: ""Parodies work with youth culture. Whether it's Stephen Colbert, The Onion, or now Nihilist Arby's, teens and young adults always love a satirical voice willing to take a shot at a powerful foe."" Kelly doesn't make any money off Nihilist Arby's, yet it doesn't sound like he's going to give up his labor-of-love anytime soon. He tries to tweet once a day, targeting the lunch crowd at around 11:30 a.m. The punk rocker said he avoids ""forcing"" humorous copy onto his fans while trying to capture culturally relevant and timely jokes that fit his brand. ""I am not cranking them out just to do it,"" Kelly said. ""If it doesn't make me laugh, I don't tweet it."" On that note, Simply Measured mined his tweets from the last several weeks, and the top 10 performers—when it comes to engagement metrics—are below. While a few of them are probably too edgy for brands to steal marketing wisdom from, others will likely prove to be instructive for millennial-minded practitioners, and the tweets collectively paint a picture of how Kelly created a social-media sensation. It's hard to argue with thousands of retweets and favorites. So enjoy. ( Eat Arby's. Then, die. ) It's 3 am. You awake in a panic. You're wasting your life? You're alone? relax.

"How to Educate Your Executives on Social Media 2015-08-17T10:23:42+00:00 Bridget Quigg
“So, how do we do on the social?”
Okay, it might not be that awkward when a senior leader at your company asks about your work, but sometimes they’re not hip to the happenings and you gotta give them the straight scoop, quickly.
Whether over email or in-person, communicating with an executive must send the message that social is essential and making the low-cost, positive impact that only it can. What IS Social Analytics?
Fortunately, executives have some favorite topics you can address for success, like growing the business, bringing in revenue, and crushing the competition. If you can touch on one or all of those topics, things are gonna be just fine.
Here are some ways to make your brilliance shine. Growing the Business
More fans means, well…more fans. We know, though, that just growing your social audience doesn’t mean growing your customer base or reach on social. You have to develop a following filled with engaged fanboys and girls who have healthy followings of their own.
Reach: When you tweet, how many eyes have a chance of seeing that post in their followers’ feeds? An audience with their own big audience matters for total impressions on Twitter.
Klout Scores: Again, if your audience is already sassy on social, the chances they’ll help spread your promotions and content to new folks gets a boost.
Engagement as a % of Audience: How often your audience responds to you shows the depth of their dedication like nothing else. If that number is growing, shout it out. This Audience Follower Distribution chart from the Simply Measured Twitter Audience Analysis report offers a sense of the reach for a brand’s Tweets. Bringing in Revenue
Social can bring in the dollars. You know it. I know it. We all know it. But, how do we show it? Conversions, people.
Website Visits: If you’re getting people from a social network onto your website, shazaam, you’re making a difference. Count ‘em up, show growth in the number, and brag on!
“Buy” Button Clicks: Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook make it very easy for people to buy your products from their networks. This simple metric is easiest for B2C companies to track. If you’re a B2C marketer, keep this number at the top of the dashboard.
Downloads: If people are downloading your content, they’re cruising down the marketing funnel straight into the sales funnel. This is a great number to share, especially if it’s growing. This Twitter Activity Funnel from Simply Measured follows a Tweet’s impact from send to site visits. Crushing the Competition
Oh, those wimpy competitors, with their empty promises and shabby products. You know, the ones you need to CRUSH. There are ways to show that you are.
Audience Size: If you have a ka-jillion more followers than a major competitor, on any of the major social networks, take a moment to shout it out. Yes, audience quality matters, but sometimes it’s just nice to hear you’re bigger and better than someone else.
Post Engagement: Did your video rock the views by being clever and funny, especially compared to your competition’s ( a-hem ) business-like video efforts? You might want to mention that, as well as Retweets, shares, or clicks on promotions, discounts, contests, and other campaigns you ran that had a great response, compared to your competition’s.
New Networks: Have you hopped on to a new network, seeing some exciting signs of life, that your competition hasn’t caught on to yet? There’s another great nugget to share. Being especially hip and innovative on social appeals to your executive friend. This activity comparison chart from Simply Measured shows how different brands’ audiences are responding on YouTube.

"Published on August 14th, 2015 | by Jules Yap 0 Rast dresser turned into desk
Materials: 2 RAST dresser and a piece of white-washed wood from the IKEA as-is section
In preparation for my new place, I bought two of these IKEA RAST dressers. I had seen them on Pinterest redone in amazing ways. I also was enticed by their low price of $34.99. I was so excited as I put them together. I had envisioned them as a set of dressers for my casual clothing until I realized they are only 27″ high. I am horrible at translating how tall 27 inches but basically I had to sit down on the floor to open the drawers. The drawers are also fairly shallow so one folded shirt would take up half of the drawer. I had to find a way to re-purpose these dressers since IKEA does not take returns on furniture that is already built. I decided that I would use two dressers with a piece of wood on top for a desk. I also decided to add a piece of wood across the bottom so that I could attach casters to the dressers. This would improve the height issue and make them easy to maneuver if needed. Classic Gray 271
First, I assembled both sets of dressers and lightly sanded the pieces that were on the outside. The nice thing about the RAST is that they are made of pine not MDF. Now it was time to choose the stain color. I chose Miniwax Wood Finish in Classic Grey. In this picture it looks very gray but on the dresser it has a blue tint. I prefer the blue tint. The instructions say to wait a minute or two between when you brush on the stain and when you wipe the stain off with a rag/cloth. I was staining in Charleston, South Carolina in the summer so there was no need to wait. I would immediately remove the stain and applied a second coat if I desired a darker color.
Here is where I had to go off script and figure out my own path. The RAST was too small for a desk and I wasn’t sold on just adding legs. Adding casters to the bottom was the perfect solution because it raised the dressers to an acceptable height and also allowed them to roll around. To attach the casters I had to first add a piece of wood to the bottom of the dressers. The RAST has no bottom shelf and the wood also provided some stability. I choose pre-cut pine boards and then simply measured the width and depth that I needed. I attached the wood to the dresser with wood screws and next attached the casters.
In the second picture (right) , the blueish-grey color is more apparent. I made sure to wipe down the wood so that the grain was visible. This gives the desk a farmhouse/antique feel. Instead of using the knobs that were provided by IKEA, I purchased 12 from ebay. These ceramic knobs are a bright white with light grey crackling. They were fairly cheap at around $2 a knob but they came from India and took about three weeks to arrive at my house.
There is an IKEA across the street from my job so I am constantly browsing the As-Is section. I was able to locate a long piece of white-washed wood that would be perfect for the desk top. The piece only cost $5 and I have no clue what the wood was originally designed for.
Here you can see the final product. I attached the wood to the wall with shelf brackets — two on each side and the front is supported by the dresser. I chose not to attach the wooden top to the dressers so that I can reuse the pieces later for a different function. The desk works perfectly and has more than enough room for all my craft projects.

"-This is a common problem when converting from generator to alternator on old Mopars....
The new (electronic) regulator doesn't have any terminal to connect to the ""idiot light""..
I have solved this problem by connecting a new ""voltage sensing relay"", that simply measures the battery voltage, and turn on the light if too low....
-You could buy a ""voltage sensing relay"" (used in some boats, etc..), but they are pretty expensive, so I've made one myself...:
I took a common 12V relay , with 5 terminal, which means that it has both ""Normal Closed =NC"" and ""Normal Off=NO"" function.
Now, we want the light to be on when the battery voltage is under 12V, which shows the condition when NOT charging, so we put the idiot light to the connection: ""NC"" on the relay..., and the ""Common=C"" to Ground (Chassis)
-To get the relay to ""Cut in"" at around 14V, which means that the alternator is charging, we have to put in a Zener-diode in series with the realy coil....-the value of this Zenerdiode depends on the specific relay(coil resistance, etc.) and will have to be determined by ""trial & error""...
-In my case, I ended up with 2 pcs 5.6 V Zenerdiode in series with the relay coil to get the wanted cutin voltage of 14 V...
(I did a mild bend also (inside relay) on the NC terminal towards the coil, to get a shorter way for relay-arm to travel..-this seemed to give a better cutin/cutout response...)

"Stay marketing-savvy and tech-savvy. Get the latest in martech by subscribing to MarTech Today. SUBSCRIBE Simply Measured Acquires Social Intelligence Firm DataRank Social analytics firm adds Y Combinator company that focuses on ranking and organizing online conversations about brands. Martin Beck on October 13, 2015 at 9:01 am
Simply Measured announced today that it is acquiring social intelligence company DataRank to add another arrow to its quiver of marketing tools.
It’s the second big purchase in the last couple months for the Seattle-based social analytics firm. In September, it acquired ROI specialist Inside Social . This time it is picking up DataRank, a Y Combinator graduate based in Fayetteville, Ark.
DataRank focuses on helping marketers gather business insights from conversations on social media and other online sources. Its dashboard ranks and organizes those conversations, filtering out off-topic comments, to give brands better information to inform their digital campaigns.
“We have proven the importance of social intelligence by helping leading enterprise brands research, discover and take action on their most important social conversations,” DataRank CEO Ryan Frazier said in a statement. “The partnership with Simply Measured gives us the ability to help marketers through all of their critical campaign stages, from research, to measurement, to justifying ROI after the fact.”
Simply Measured said the addition of DataRank gives it the most comprehensive analytics solution in the industry.
“The main struggle for marketers today is how to find, understand and leverage data to improve campaign performance for their brand,” Simply Measured CEO Adam Schoenfeld said in the statement. “Basing campaign decisions on passive listening and vanity metrics is no longer enough to show social ROI or justify the investment to CMOs.
“Marketers need real social intelligence and research to discover new opportunities, understand online conversation, and take action. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we’re providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success.” About The Author Martin Beck Martin Beck is Third Door Media's Social Media Reporter, covering the latest news for Marketing Land and Search Engine Land.

"Well, there's several things going on in that scenario.

First, ""the same day"", is that day the first day that the game has come out at all? Because any day after that, and there will be people at the top-level anyway. *Even on* the first day, there's people who will have taken that day off, and have been playing since midnight or whatever, who will be way ahead.

Second, even getting everything shouldn't usually even be much of a strict *advantage* anyway, in a well-balanced game. If the starting weapons aren't even viable, that's not a very good game.

To answer your question though, yes, I do think it's reasonably *fair*, because there will always be people with that ""advantage"" over Guy#2, no matter what. Whatever happens, there'll be people ahead of you and people behind you.

The detail you left you is that Guy#1 works 80 hours a week and Guy#2 is a highschool kid with nothing else to do. After a couple of days, he's gotten everything anyway. Without a shortcut available, do you think it's fair that Guy#2 gets an advantage over Guy#1 just because he is able to throw down a ton of time as soon as he bought the game? He's not even any good at the game, he's just got the sheer hours to inevitably push the level meter higher.

Ultimately, the problem in either of those scenarios is simply measuring your own enjoyment as being reliant on your status in relation to other players. That's just a recipe for a bad time. Like I said, no matter what, there's going to be someone with more than you, whether it's time, skill, or money, it doesn't really make a difference."

Their returns are extremely different, but each tiny movement in the first lines up with the correspondingly larger one in the latter. TSM and TBM is very similar - the ups and downs are driven by the stocks since they are so much more volatile than bonds. True for 20/80, 40/60, 60/40 or 80/20 - but no one would consider those to be portfolios of similar returns or behavior. It may be a way to overemphasize the point, but I think it underlines how much a 60:40 portfolio really is a fairly strong bet on the equity risk-premium - which has been known to take long holidaysThe market itself perhaps considers it too strong a bet It is simply showing that stocks are more volatile than bonds. Nothing new or surprising there. This is true whether or not the equity risk premium is large or small - that simply does not matter. Just look at how two imaginary assets with 0% mean return and one with 1% std and the other with 10% std form portfolios. You get the same basic behavior. Can you clarify what you mean by: "The market itself perhaps considers it too strong a bet"? Think of it this way - a perfect diversifier would have the same risk characteristics as stocks, but little-to-no correlation .. The very least this would guarantee is significantly improved risk-adjusted returnsIn a 60:40 portfolio, 90% of the risk is in stocks .. So to achieve an optimal Shape ratio (and this is obviously the Risk Parity concept) you'd balance your portfolio so stocks and bonds assumed 50% risk each .. Which would leave you with something much closer to the Global Market Portfolio's roughly 1/3rd allocation to stocksAs the market can use leverage, can use derivatives, and doesn't want to lose money, it's constantly weighing risk against opportunity .. If you follow Efficient Markets, the Global Market Portfolio achieves the best risk-adjusted blend of assets .. Over-weighting stocks is a bet against the market .. Just as overweighting energy would be; just as overweighting value stocks or private equity would be I think we are saying largely the same thing. I would quibble that the perfect diversifier for stocks would not be one with little-to-no correlation but rather one with correlation -1. Alas such a thing does not exist.Basically in the real world if we start with US stocks we could try international stocks, but their return and risk are so similar that the diversification benefit has historically been very small. There is a nice graph in the wiki that shows this (the axes on the graph have been blown way up to magnify the effect of different allocations visible at all).We could try bonds, but the volatility of stocks is so much higher than bonds that for large or even moderate stock allocations mostly you just get dilution of risk - one might easily call that a diversification benefit, it is certainly a desired benefit. As you point out when you get down near the risk parity portfolio (mostly bonds) you see the a much different situation where you can improve both return and risk vs bonds alone which would be a diversification benefit by any definition.But that is not the entire story as shown in this graph I pulled off the internet:In both the 1970s and 2000s the situation is that bonds were the winners, not stocks. Here I would argue is a very real and very important diversification benefit that is not simply measured by long term risk adjusted return type measures or long term correlation measures.While most of us are in the market longer than a decade or so, because we invest little by little our effective time in the market is only a decade or two. Another way to look at is that most of us don't have a ton of money invested until well into middle age when all this investment theory becomes the driver vs our new money investments. At any rate, for someone like myself deep into middle age, looking forward, I don't have even one decade before I need to start taking out money so shorter term behavior matters a lot. If we get another decade of poor stock performance starting today, I will be darn glad of whatever benefit I get from not being 100% stocks - whether one wants to call that a diversification benefit or wants to call it something else. We live a world with knowledge of the future markets has less than one significant figure. And people will still and always demand answers to three significant digits.

Okay so it's firewood fully loaded up to a 4 x 8 foot trailer. typical prices for seasoned hardwood firewood would be in the region of 80 euro per loose cubic metre of volume. so, simply measure and multiply in metres the length breadth and height of your trailer, and multiply the result by 80 euro per cube.
you did not mention the height of your trailer nor whether it was hard or softwood, nor whether it was seasoned, what is the moisture content etc

Here are some cool social media tools worth checking out :
Wordsmith for Marketing : This tool from Automated Insights automatically transforms Google Analytics, AdWords and social data into clear and simple-to-read client reports.

SoundCloud Pulse : This new Android app is “a companion to SoundCloud’s existing app and will enable creators to manage their accounts and keep their communities humming – anytime, anywhere.”
SoundCloud Pulse lets you reply to comments on the go, get up-to-date stats, share your sounds (both publicly and privately) and follow other users.
News From a Partner, Simply Measured: Smart Social Marketers Put Analytics First : For years now, social marketers have prioritized publishing over analytics to increase efficiency in their high-volume roles. This is understandable, but this bias for action causes them to ignore the need for informed decision-making. For marketers to find sustainable success from their social media programs, this has to change. Better social starts by putting analytics first.

Some Interesting Studies to Note: Millennials on Social Media : Venture capital firm Battery Ventures and market-research company Ipsos surveyed more than 1,000 people between the ages of 20 and 35 on their social media usage. This study offers marketers insights on how and where to reach this demographic online. The key takeaway is that marketers should rely on a nuanced approach rather than a blanket strategy to reach Millennials online.
2015 U.S. State of the Video Industry : According to a survey of nearly 300 U.S. brands, agencies and publishers by AOL Platforms, marketers are reprioritizing traditional video advertising budgets and shifting more of their spending to digital video. Half of those surveyed are reallocating their advertising budget from TV to digital channels, and mobile video is an area for increased investment. Branded video content is an essential area of focus for marketers with over 30% of brands’ digital video budgets being dedicated to it, and further growth is expected.
Locowise Instagram Study October 2015 : The most recent Instagram study from Locowise shows that organic growth and engagement declined in October 2015. Instagram post engagement in October decreased 23% compared to September, continuing an almost 52% overall decline in engagement from April to October 2015. However, new advertising opportunities on Instagram give marketers new ways to reach their audience. For instance, the study reports that carousel ads drive an additional 2.5-point lift in ad recall compared to single photo campaigns.
2015 Pinterest Media Consumption Study : Ahalogy compiled survey data from 1,015 online consumers on Pinterest usage and attitudes toward the site. The study shows there are 75% more male pinners today than a year ago, when a previous survey was compiled. Males are the fastest-growing group on Pinterest, with almost 64% having joined in the past year and shifting the balance between male and female users by 4%. Males are also significantly more likely to click on promoted pins to get more information and to make purchases based on the pin.
The Q4 2015 Sprout Social Index : Based on new data from Sprout Social, 83% of retailers ignore customer requests on social media, while the rest make people wait an average of 12 hours to get a response. This report analyzes major trends for brand response rates and times, retailers’ social behaviors, consumer preferences for networks and responsive metrics.

But I'm going to be a multi-millionaires and hopefully billionaire in the next decade. Why? Because I work 12 hours per day every day doing things others *don't* do. Everyone's answer to that statement is almost always, "I work that hard too but I'm not going to make that much!". You can't simply measure *hard work* by hours. You must separate yourself from the pack. Stop selling your soul to the grind and working for other people. Learn what other people don't know and become an expert. Be a visionary, an entrepreneur, a creative mind. That's how you move up in the world now. The issue isn't *wealth inequality*, the issue isn't *this country*. The issue is the internet. Every day since the inception of the internet we are a more and more connected planet. You aren't competing versus your group of coworkers anymore. You aren't even competing against your town or city anymore. Everyone is competing against everyone. If you want to be somebody you have to be *different*. Out with the old in with the new. If you can't hack it get out of the way.

"Originally Posted by Jag1 Gee, where did you dig that reference up? I don't think I'm going to put any credence in a blog of hare-brained theories (""fat cells just say NO to any more fat"") written by someone who calls himself a veterinary anaesthestist, even though he has no specialized medical training in giving pain meds to cats beyond a bachelors degree.
But even your favorite veterinarian makes no claims about fat percentages. So how do you come to believe that 30% is the same as 90%? What kind of math is that? The way it really works is pretty simple. For the example given, 5-30% is from ingested carb; 10% is from ingested fat. The remaining 60-85% is from our fat cells - and how do you decrease that - well by decreasing the fat in our fat cells - i.e. by LOSING WEIGHT.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to stick with real science that teaches that the best way to regain insulin sensitivity is to lose weight, and the best way to do that is by increasing exercise and cutting calories - in particular by cutting down on sugar, refined carbs, total fat and saturated fat. I'm going to do that because THAT has been tested in studies performed by real scientists in the real world and it works. Just read the article I gave you a link to - because you obviously haven't read it yet. I did and found no such thing. Particularly everything they said about ""fat"". It was ALL couched in phrases of GUESSING like ""may"", etc. A priori assumptions mostly awaiting the proof they are just SURE will come - but hasn't yet. Oh and I think there was one ridiculous study with way too few subjects and too short. I think it was 9 people for 6 weeks.
No argument about benefits of reducing carbs and calories, so try not to conflate the two. Yes, that part is well known. It's main problem, however, is sustainability in a still stubbornly lipophobic context. It is a WOE which produces raging and frequent hunger and will not be retained for long by many. Moreover, the statistics show that even the 3% who do lose weight this way, when they inevitably fall off the wagon, they put MORE weight back on than they had in the first place. If it were ""doable"" in real-life, the diet industry would have a success rate higher than it's current 3%!
Yeah, shoot the messenger - great last resort. Your desperate flight from subject at hand is showing. He has the same training as Ansel Keys, physiology. Wait, I guess that not a very good recommendation, is it? He is extremely widely read in all the latest science - and because of his training can actually understand all of it - and is one of the best debunkers out there. Moreover, he cites TONS of your beloved ""real science"" and more correctly than most.
The blatant flaws he finds in lots of studies - outright fraud in many cases - are astounding. And, it's right there a lot of times in the actual data that recent laws force them to make available along with their ""findings"". Unfortunately, very few - even professionals let along average people - ever get past the ""Abstract"" which many times is utterly contradicted by the accompanying data, let alone the newspaper headline.
One of my favorites is that nearly every rat study of ""high fat diets"" actually involve extremely high SUGAR (and/or CORN OIL) diets. As a vet, I guess he's well positioned to track down the actual ""lab chow"" by the numbers given and expose what they actually are. So, if you only read the headline and/or abstract, you are totally misled about what you just read without debunkers like Peter.
30 + 60 = 90. 30 from lipogenesis + 60 from inappropriately leaking adipocites. (That was from YOUR reference, BTW, along with the subsequent one I posted - they both agreed on the numbers.) Both are related to short-term and long-term glucose/insulin elevation, resulting in increased lipogenesis and the failure of adipose to respond properly to insulin (adipose IR). The mere presence of fat does no harm at all, unless it is not responding properly to insulin's ""store and hold"" command. Adipose should only release NEFA in a low energy/low insulin context when it gets used for energy and does no harm. This is why a 360 pound non-diabetic (22 years old) I tested had tighter BG than everyone I tested - practically 83 all the time no matter what he ate.
If you read the link, you'd see that leaking adipocites can also relate to ""obesity"" of sorts, but not the kind that can be simply measured as body weight. In fact, they can be ""full"" and begin leaking at any body weight. If Ken's guesses about his NEFA being high in spite of low body weight are correct, he may be an example of this. BTW, none of this is in dispute among ""real"" scientists. Adipocites inappropriately putting out NEFA is quite well-known. It is also clear that it is another failure to respond to insulin - i.e., another form of IR."

"Inherently knowing that there is value in social media marketing and being equipped to show value are two different things.
Social media provides a unique and often-challenging opportunity to connect one-on-one with customers, prospects and fans of your business. However, only 42% of marketers feel that they are able to accurately measure the value of their social media efforts .
“Social media enables relationships to be built regardless of traditional barriers like distance or language. For brands, this provides a forum to listen and learn – and if you’re smart, take action based off of what you learn,” says Alison Herzog , Marketing Director, Global Social Business & Digital Strategy at Dell, ( a TopRank Marketing client ).
Social media strategy has become a fundamental part of most marketing plans. But as marketers, we are pushed to show the value of these programs. To help you do just that, here are three ways you can measure and share the value of your social media marketing.
#1 – Understand Your Current Situation When creating your social media measurement strategy, start by defining the outcomes you are looking to achieve. Once you understand what success should look like, you can set your strategy and define your key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring progress. The actual metrics you use should be based on the KPIs or action they represent.
For example, if your ongoing social media marketing goal is to increase brand awareness and improve traffic back to your brand’s website you should:
Set benchmarks on where your brand is currently ranking on all social media channels. Create a competitive analysis of your brand versus your top competitors. Additionally, there are many tools (native and 3 rd party) that can help you measure towards your social media marketing goals.
Some tools to help you review your competitor’s social media presence include:
SimplyMeasured Rival IQ socialbakers Facebook Insights Twitter measurement tool examples:
Topsy Twitonomy Twitalyzer You will want to review your competitors overall followers, the frequency of their postings, and engagement of posts. Also, use a search or listening tool, to find-out the overall mentions of your brand compared to your competitors.
To understand the source of your web traffic, use a web analytics tool, like Google Analytics or Adobe’s SiteCatalyst to review the referring traffic sources. You can also use a link shortener, like Bit.ly , to gain additional data on who is clicking on the links in your social posts.
Once you understand the playing field, you can set goals and review your social growth on an ongoing basis. Regular evaluation is key to understanding what is working and what isn’t.
The great thing about social media is it is easy to adjust course mid-plan and optimize if you see a type of post or messaging that isn’t capturing an audience.
#2 – Set Specific Campaign Goals Depending on what you are hoping to achieve, specific campaigns will require different metrics to show value. Social media has proven to be a very effective tool that can be used to target a particular audience to increase brand awareness (or meet other marketing goals) in a unique and conversational way. Below are some examples of recent social media campaigns that achieved great results:
Clif Bar
In 2014 Clif Bar created a campaign focused entirely on content created by their fans. Brand enthusiasts were asked to share an environmental friendly photo under the hashtag #MeettheMoment. For each photo that was shared, Clif agreed to donate $1 to an environmental non-profit. When all was said and done, Clif not only donated a cool $60,000, but they had made their fans part of something memorable.
Lowes
Lowes found a unique way to present users with a clever social campaign around six second life hacks. They used 6 second vine videos to share easy lifehacks for everything from getting scratches out of your wood floor to making a pillow case out of an old t-shirt. Their inventive social campaign garnered over 4 million views putting Lowes on the Vine map.
#3 – Communicate Value to Your Internal Audience By this point, all marketers are aware that any social media marketing program should consider the audience’s needs and habits. However, we may not always think about our internal audience. For any social media program to grow and be successful, it is important to show that it is adding value to the business.
Measuring and communicating social success can sometimes be overwhelming. When preparing to show value internally, think about which internal stakeholder will be reviewing the information. Below are some metrics that you may want to consider sharing with different internal stakeholders:
Executives
Overall trends Sentiment Standing in the marketplace Conversions Managers
Engagement rate on campaign content Best performing creative or content Highlights relevant to their line of business Click-through rate from social posts to key landing pages Customer Service
Response rate Sentiment By understanding your current situation, developing goals and communicating internally, you will be able to provide more value with your social media marketing strategy – to your community and within your company.
What have you found to be the biggest barriers in creating value with social media within your organization?

Here is the MTF for this lens: http://erphotoreview.com/wordpress/?p=1123&page=2 What I am asking is - if this lens would be tested on the A7, the MTF scores will increase? I mean...the lens will be sharper on the higher mpx camera or not? No, a lens' MTF characteristic (resolving power) does not change - rather the sensor's ability to register this resolving power is limited by the sensor's density. As long as the lens out-resolves the sensor, you are simply measuring the sensor's ability. Only if the lens is at the limit (and becomes a blur filter), you will see lens limitations. But do check DxO - they show the same lens resolving power on different resolution sensors (all same size, e.g. APS-C), with higher scores being produced on the higher resolution sensors (which makes sense).  So yes, your A7 images will be sharper than the D700 images (24Mp versus 12Mp), as long as you view this in a manner where this is visible (print, enlargement, higher-res/multi monitor). Furthermore, MTF curves are at e.g. 50% or 18%. 50% is most telling for the lens (sharpness), but 18% is sufficient for post-processing tools to bring contrast and detail levels back up to 50% (for human eye). -- hide signature -- Cheers, Henry
"Ben Donkor Is Taking Over Our Instagram for #LIFTSocial 2015-10-15T14:12:33+00:00 Jade Furubayashi
You might know him as @FR314 , but we know him as Ben Donkor, a digital marketing pro with a love for Beyoncé or social analytics.
Ben Donkor is a talented and seasoned Social Media Analyst, and now works at Microsoft. Why are we talking about our best friend Ben? Because he’s taking over our Instagram account during the #LIFTSocial conference!
You will be able to follow along with Ben’s long, adventurous trip from the UK to Seattle, and stick with him throughout the =LIFT(Social) experience.
We gave Ben a ring across the pond and asked him a few questions about what he’s looking forward to most. How do you feel about taking over our Instagram account?
I’m thrilled and excited! It’s my first time in Seattle and the first-ever Simply Measured conference.
I’ve been asking for a Simply Measured conference for years, so I’m psyched it’s finally come together and I can be a part of it. Could you talk a little bit more about your relationship with SM?
A few years ago, when I was back at Groupon, I basically had no social tools whatsoever. As a Social Media Analyst, I needed tools to do my work!
The first solution that came to mind was Simply Measured — that was the best option out of all the ones I had researched. While using the trial, I actually felt like, “You know, this isn’t just a great tool for me, but a great tool for my colleagues and so many other marketers.” *taps mic* So…I'm going to be in Seattle next week, so if anyone would like to recommend best places to get carbs & guac, slide in my DMs 👍🏾
— Ben Donkor (@FR314) October 12, 2015

I just started going crazy on Twitter first and then on my blog I wrote a love note to Simply Measured . It just made my whole life so much easier. Those were the days! Fast forward to now, at my new job, where we also use Simply Measured. That was a huge relief on my first day. What are you most excited for at the conference?
I’m excited to see the Simply Measured folks speak. You follow someone on Twitter and you think they sound one way…but they sound totally different in person.
I assume that Uri Bar-Joseph probably sounds like Barry White, but when I meet him he might actually sound like Future. Uri Bar-Joseph Future Who are you most excited to see speak?
There are a bunch of sessions and panels I look forward to seeing. I’m really looking forward to the Social Marketing Trends for 2016 panel. It’ll be great for me to see what the panelists think is the next-hot-thing, but also give ideas about how to tackle them.
I expect this conference to not only say why so-and-so is going to be huge, but what we as marketers can do to capitalize on developments in the field. Work aside, what’s one thing you have to do before you leave Seattle?
I know that Seattle is big on football and sports, and I’m not at all. But, you know what else I’m big on? Food.
I know that the Seattle Restaurant Week is happening while I’m in town, so I’m going to be going up and down, east and west, around Seattle. I’m also going to have to go to Starbucks because it’s Pumpkin Spice Latte season. This picture is sooo 2014. Send in a pic of me looking really awesome and I'll pick my fave. #PSLHeaderChallenge pic.twitter.com/darREjYjVS

by: obsequiouswager73 Not everyone enjoys home improvement and they have a hard time with it too. There are some jobs that nearly anyone can do once they understand what is involved. Use the tips below to help understand more about home improvement projects and what type of effort, time and expense is involved before jumping in.Hire a professional to do a inspection of your new home. This way, you'll be clear on what repairs or replacements need to be made. Enlisting a professional inspector who does not have a stake in the sale is a smart method of keeping things honest.If you don't have much counter space in the kitchen, think about a microwave over your range. Over-the-range microwave ovens offer many features, including convection cooking. The majority of these units feature recirculating filters rather than vents, so they are best for people who do not need powerful venting options. http://www.window-cleaning-melbourne.com.au/window-cleaning-melbourne-services - window cleaner - When you start home improvements, you should think about how much you will have to do. Sit down and make a list of everything you have to do. You should also seek the opinion of another on the off chance you overlooked something. You can save a lot of money just by keeping to a plan that includes everything you will need to do.When you need to replace a lock, you can opt to replace the entire assembly, or you can just replace the cylinder. The locking action is accomplished by the cylinder. Simply purchase a cylinder replacement if you misplace your key. If you want to install an upgrade, then revamp the entire unit.Be mindful of which product you choose to help clean a nasty clog. Different types of cleaners won't contain the same ingredients, and some can be much harsher than others. Crystallized types of drain cleaners may damage your plumbing and should be avoided. Be certain that the drain cleaner you choose will not negatively impact your septic tank.Whether you are painting one room, or all of them, take the time to determine the amount of paint you will need. Don't guess about the costs because that can end up costing you big time. Take your time and simply measure what you are painting.One good investment to make is finishing your basement. By renovating your basement, you will surely add an extra room that your family could use. The essential materials can be bought from discount stores. The resale value of a house with a finished basement increases by over 30%.There are simple steps you can take to figure out what's wrong when your water pressure falls. To begin, inquire whether neighbors have a similar problem. If nobody shares your problem, at least you know the source of it is inside your house. The next step is to look at the pressure you are getting from each individual faucet. This will help you understand if this is a problem affecting your entire home. You might just need to adjust an aerator, but if not you might want to get a professional to assist you.You need to make sure you think about the paint before any other projects are attempted in the room. It is much easier to paint the walls and the ceiling first before you get new floor installed. Although you can use a drop cloth to protect things while you're painting, it's better to avoid the problem entirely if you can.Have you been thinking about renovating a part of your home? You are probably thinking through all of the work and cost that could be involved. Drafting a plan for your project is important to completing the project, but before you begin, you need to do your research. The advice given here will assist you in the planning stages of making those decisions.

"GET FIT Transitional Clothing for Motherhood by PinkBlush Maternity
Congratulations – you’re pregnant! Unfortunately, your body is changing (as it should be) and your favorite pair of skinny jeans are starting to get a little tight. It’s finally time to invest in some new clothes, but the prospect of buying an entirely new maternity wardrobe seems like a lot of money for a relatively short period of time.
The good news is that PinkBlush Maternity now offers maternity clothes that are affordable and fashionable enough to wear before, during and after your pregnancy , also known as transitional clothing for motherhood. Transitional clothing is designed with the same look of your pre-pregnancy clothes with a little more room in the bust, belly and waist; right where you need it most! Why Buy Transitional Clothing?
If you’re expecting, you may find that your pre-pregnancy clothes are getting a little uncomfortable almost as soon as you get a positive pregnancy test; especially if this is your second (or subsequent) pregnancy. However, you may not be quite ready to tell the world that you’re pregnant, so looking “normal” is pretty important.
Postpartum, if you’re breastfeeding, you may find that your baby weight disappears right away; but for many women, shedding that pregnancy weight can take up to four months (or longer).
Why buy clothing that is a few sizes bigger when you can just invest in some transitional pieces that will last throughout your pregnancy and beyond?
Some perfect transitional pieces from PinkBlush Maternity include: Nursing Friendly Dresses
Most maternity dresses will fit perfectly at all stages of your pregnancy because they are designed to provide more than enough room to grow while still showing your beautiful figure. We particularly love maxi and wrap style dresses that can be tightened or loosened to your liking. These dresses are also nursing friendly which makes for a perfect transition from pregnancy into motherhood.
This sky blue maternity and nursing maxi dress has a deep v-neckline, which allows for nursing after pregnancy. During warm months, this maxi dress is comfortable and flowing, allowing plenty of airflow on a hot day. Transition this dress into your fall wardrobe by wearing it under a jean jacket or light cardigan.
On a similar note, skirts and other bottoms with a band that can be lifted or folded are perfect transitional pieces. Maxi style skirts with a band can be folded over before and after, and can be lifted to conform to your bump during your pregnancy.
We are particularly loving this bold navy multi-color chevron print maxi skirt for fall this year. Simply pair with your favorite basic top such as this white 3/4 sleeve fitted maternity top with necklace for a laid-back look on any occasion. Add a navy blue maternity cardigan for a more professional look.
These types of pieces are sure to add versatility to your wardrobe. Simply mix and match! Long and Comfortable Tunics
Long gone are the days of old maternity mumus. Yuck! Instead, opt for a gorgeous tunic that can be worn in a variety of ways. Whether you wear them alone as a short dress, paired with leggings and a belt, or a great pair of skinny jeans, we love the extra length that a tunic provides.
In particular, we really love the light hue and faded tribal print of this lightweight knit tunic. While the color leans slightly toward spring, we really love its feminine style and comfortable fit that will keep you cozy and in style from fall through spring. The Perfect Pair of Jeans
If this is your first pregnancy, you will likely try to avoid wearing a pair of maternity jeans for as long as possible. Don’t get us wrong, most of us have tried those bands that allow you to unbutton your jeans without the fear of your pants falling down OR tried connecting our jeans with rubber bands. However, you’ll feel so much better about your changing body with a nice well-fitted pair of maternity jeans.
PinkBlush has a large selection of maternity jeans . We particularly love a dark pair of skinny jeans for fall such as these in Navy Blue that pair nicely with just about any top or tunic. Alternatively, for a more casual look, we really like these light blue basics. These basic skinny jeans are both comfortable and flattering on all figures. We plan to wear these jeans tucked into tall riding boots and an oversized sweater later this year.
Simply measure the largest part of your hips for your size (it’ll likely be the same as your pre-pregnancy size). The stretch in the jeans and the mid-belly band will comfortably adjust with your bump as it grows. Stylish Transitional Tops
There are several types of tops that you’ll see as you’re shopping for maternity wear. However, we challenge you to look beyond those tops targeted strictly towards expecting mothers and more towards tops that will flatter your body from maternity to motherhood.
You’ll find that most maternity tops fit snug with a stretchy material so they will show your curves yet grow with you during your pregnancy. Of course, what we’re also finding is that most of today’s maternity tops look much like any other trendy top.
Many expecting mothers will fall into the trap of trying to hide their growing body with dark solid colors. Don’t hide! Embrace the bump and experiment with your clothing. We especially like the idea of incorporating subtle (or not so subtle) details such as a bold chevron printed sleeve and pocket accent , a flattering striped top with a fun elbow patch ( similar to this style ) or an amazing lace detailed back in fun, light hues . These little details add a modern twist to an otherwise simply stated outfit and will easily wash away the baby drool when you’re wearing them postpartum.
Also look for bold colors and patterns. While we’re not suggesting that you hide your figure during pregnancy, bold patterns can distract the eye and camouflage your shape, causing others to notice what you’re wearing instead of your growing size. This might be especially useful to you in the early weeks of pregnancy when you’re feeling kinda frumpy or postpartum as you are trying to lose your baby weight.
We think this white, black and red Tribal Chevron long sleeve maternity top does just that. Not only is this top the softest maternity long sleeve out there, the vibrant hue and bold print will give you that loud statement and splash of color your wardrobe is missing. Simply paired with a basic black maternity legging , you will want to wear this comfortable and casual long sleeve every day.
With these fun, stylish and transitional pieces from PinkBlush Maternity in your closet, you have no excuse for wearing your yoga pants day in and day out. SHOP"

This is a simple gateway to the Exi-Chat mailinglist, a discussion group for Transhumanist topics. Its been setup for those who'd prefer to follow the discussions with an RSS reader. Sunday, August 23, 2015 [ExI] Old Nutrition Studies The China study is old. It started in 1983 and measured variables of diet known at the time. We know a lot more now. Nobody should be taking their advice from such an old study. The question of whether this study was "right" or "wrong" is irrelevant. We know a lot more nuance about nutrition now than we did then. So arguing whether this study was right or wrong misses the point about whether we should eat meat, fat, cholesterol, or turn vegetarian. Here are some examples of what has changed since the China study and other similar older studies. 1. Early statistics seemed to show that meat causes cancer. People who ate meat get cancer at statistically higher rates than people who didn't eat meat. So it made sense to avoid meat. However, correlation does not mean causation. Later studies subdivided variables to try to isolate how and why meat causes cancer. It turns out that cooking method was one of the big factors in this. Charring meat with heat creates carcinogens. If we cook meat without charring it, we avoid the creation of most of these carcinogens. Does that mean the original studies were wrong and meat did not cause cancer? I say no. As a whole, most meat really was causing cancer. But does this mean that the study was right and should we stop eating meat to avoid cancer? Again, no. We now know how to cook meat to avoid these charring induced carcinogens. Does that mean reality changed or the studies keep flip-flopping? No, we learn more and more and keep further refining our nutritional understanding. This is not the same as being wrong or changing our theories all the time. We are actually continually improving our theories so that they get better and better over time. 2. Early statistics seemed to show that cholesterol clogs arteries leading to heart attacks. People who had higher blood cholesterol levels get clogged arteries and have heart attacks at statistically higher rates than people who don't. So it made sense to avoid dietary cholesterol. However, correlation does not mean causation. Later studies subdivided variables even further. It turns out that dietary cholesterol is very small and does not raise blood cholesterol as much as other dietary factors that raise cholesterol. Eating cholesterol containing foods such as eggs and shellfish turns out to not raise blood cholesterol very much. However, eating lots of saturated fats and refined carbohydrates turns out to skyrocket cholesterol and related compounds like triglycerides. We also know that there are different kinds of cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol and other kinds of cholesterol. Most people have the bad kind, so most early studies found the bad results. But some people who measured "high cholesterol" actually had low bad cholesterol and high good cholesterol. Such people actually had better results they higher their good cholesterol got. So any old study (such as the China study) that simply measures "cholesterol" without distinguishing the good from the bad is practically useless. We don't know what they were measuring. We don't know if differences were in the good or bad kind. We don't correlate which changes caused which results. Does that mean the original studies were wrong and cholesterol did not cause heart attacks? I say no. As a whole, most high cholesterol readings were the bad cholesterol which really was causing heart attacks. But does this mean that the study was right and should we stop eating cholesterol or use blood cholesterol levels to predict heart attacks? Again, no. We now know that total cholesterol does not indicate good or bad predictions. We now look at different cholesterol levels and the ratios between them for better measures. Again, we are not changing the theories about cholesterol. We are further refining our nutritional understanding of how different cholesterols effect the cardiovascular system. 3. There are similar examples with eating a high fat diet. We now know that there are good fats and bad fats. Early studies did not distinguish between good fats and bad fats. We now know that some fats should be decreased in the diet while others should be increased. It is too simplistic to argue whether "fat" is good or bad. 4. A related example of refining our knowledge occurred with butter vs. margarine. Scientists were correct when they statistically correlated saturated fat with heart attacks. They suggested that people switch from butter to vegetable oils. So many people did. And many people started having more problems than before. Were the scientists wrong? Not really. We now know that most vegetable oil margarines are hydrogenated, making them even more super-saturated than the saturated fats. They also induced more trans fats, which is also a very bad dietary fat. So while scientists recommended that people switch to vegetable oils to eat less saturated far, people actually switched to hydrogenated vegetable oils which were even more saturated fat than before. While it was mistakenly believed that people were eating less saturated fat, they were actually eating much more saturated fat. We now know a lot more about the whole spectrum of fats. And we know that hydrogenated oil! s in margarines are worse than saturated fats in the same way that saturated fats are worse than natural vegetable oils. 5. There are older studies that found that the autopsied brains of people who ate soy had more dementia indications than people who did not eat soy. However it was later found that the people who ate soy were living longer. So what they really found was that older people have more dementia indications than younger people. When correlated for age, people who eat soy do not have more dementia indications than people who do not eat soy. 6. There was a recent theory that too much estrogen might cause hormone problems for males and that soy contains a pseudo-estrogen. So people stopped drinking soy milk and switched back to cow's milk. Then it was realized that cow's milk has a magnitude more times real estrogen than soy has pseudo estrogens. If people really wanted to avoid estrogen, they should stop drinking cow's milk and switch to soy milk. My point with these various examples is that science works over time and keeps getting better and better. But it's not perfect. We cannot argue whether an older study is right or wrong. The answer is almost always more nuanced and has to be subdivided into other better questions about what was right and what was wrong. Ideas about increasing or decreasing a single food group (meat, grains, dairy) or a single macronutrient (fat, protein, carbs) are usually too simplistic. The more we study these questions, the more they fragment into many more precise questions until the original question becomes meaningless. Are carbs good or bad? Is fat good or bad? Is meat good or bad? Is vegetarianism better or worse? Is veganism better or worse? All of these are invalid questions. Depending what kinds of carbs, fats, meats, vegetarian diet or vegan diet you choose, you can answer these questions either way. And the answer to the question about whether any particular study is good or bad should be approach by looking at further refined studies. It almost never can be answered by deciding if the study is good (and accepting all of its conclusions) or deciding that a study is bad (and rejecting all of its conclusions). Both of these extreme edge-case positions is almost always wrong. --

"Welcome to HW.
First understand what PSA is and what it isn't. It's not a test for cancer, it simply measures prostate activity. A high reading simply means you need more tests to find out what is going on.
I am going to assume you're worried about having PC. Well, your PSA is acting more like an infection (prostatitis) than PC. prostatitis can cause rapid changes in PSA. PC tends to grow slower and almost PSA doesn't drop like that without treatment.
A retest is a good idea. A biopsy seems overkill right now. Before you go that route you need to elemiate all other possible reasons why your PSA went up and then down. prostatitis, BPH, the gel, sex, bike riding can all cause your PSA to go up. Cancer is very low on the list.
Check out the sticky threads at the top of the forum for more info.
Hang in there and keep us updated on your progress,
Andrew"

You are ignoring the part where I explained why argument by authority is a logical fallacy, why we should be discussing facts and not people, and why taking a far too generalized statement as the basis for anything is at best misleading. I'll put it here again before we're going in circles: The reason I argue so vehemently against your position is that I simply don't believe that arguing on the basis of the relative prestige of whoever made a statement has much merit, especially not if there is objective data available instead. Sure, such data may not be perfect, but dismissing it out of hand seems like throwing away your best chance to make a reasoned assessment. Basically, the problem is this. One developer can say that they get a factor of 10 performance improvement on console compared to an equivalently specced PC. Another can say they see less than 2% improvement. Both can very well be right. At the same time. Maybe the former is looking at a draw-call limited scenario and comparing DX9 code on PC to very low level code on console. And the other is simply measuring the time it takes for his main deferred shading pixel shader to run. And that's the true issue with the "2x" quote and its ilk: it's simply not specific enough to be of any value. It doesn't reduce down to a "truth" or a "lie" as you would seem to believe. Because of this ambiguity, these quotes are dragged out in every argument, regardless of their applicability to the scenario, component or bottleneck being discussed. What you get then is a simple appeal to authority, and discussions that go in circles and never get to the actual issues.

Read on and learn some great tips to help you with your next home improvement project.Use a porch light with a motion sensor to cut down on your electric bill. You can manually adjust the sensitivity of the light, as well as turn it on without engaging the motion sensor if you need to.To save space on your kitchen counters, install an overhead microwave oven. An over-the-range microwave replaces the range hood. This type of microwave is available in many prices with a wide variety of options. They are especially good for cooks who aren't too focused on ventilation, as they use a recirculating filter only.If you plan to install paneling, you should first paint stripes on the wall. Regardless of your skill, it seems inevitable that some of the old wall will show through. To help camouflage this effect and keep this from being distracting, measure out where each panel will meet before your installation. Paint strips of the wall with a paint color that will better match the color of the paneling.Prioritize the rooms you plan to improve. Just improve different rooms gradually to save you some money and time. Identify the main area you want to work on, then look for deals or sales that will help you complete the project. You will always save some money on your project if you take the time to create a plan first.Try getting rid of bubbles in your vinyl floor. You can easily slice into the vinyl floor and let out the air. This will make http://valeroofing.com.au/ - roofing companies Perth - the bubble go away. Make sure you add some fresh glue so that your repairs will be held onto the floor. Syringe-based applicators that are already filled with glue do the best job.Remove any excess cord that is hanging from your blinds. It is possible for kids and animals to accidentally strangle themselves on such cords. Make sure that you leave some length so that you can open and close your blinds, though not any more than you need. Simple safety fixes like this one are free, fast and may even save a life.Any painting job requires you to estimate the amount of paint you require. Don't just glance at what you need to do and make a guess, you may end up spending too much money. Take your time and simply measure what you are painting.Solar lights won't do anything to improve the value of your home. If you instead want to light up your yard for safety and aesthetics, you need electric lighting. Although these lights are more costly, they will last longer and are more reliable than solar models.In order to free up floor or tabletop space, it's a great idea to hang a television from a wall-mounted bracket instead of using a ordinary stand. Installing a wall mount is fairly simple, and if you follow the instructions, it generally only takes around 30 minutes or so.One way to increase your home's market value is to refinish the hardwood floors. Though a large task, re-finishing your floors is not hard. You can often take a quick class on the subject at local hardware stores, where you can also rent necessary equipment. This can save you a lot of money.You should now be aware that home improvement is not nearly as daunting as it first appears. It's hard to deny the increase in value and enjoyment of your home that accompanies the successful completion of a home improvement project.
Tom, there is no science in your post. You can't simply measure the area of the hole, divide it by the area of the filter and then decide based on the low percentage that it's irrelevant. It ignores that the oil will follow the path of least resistance. The proportion of the area of the hole is not the same as the proportion of oil that will go through that hole. You have not quantified that, at least in your post here. To say this is a non issue based on the information you've provided thus far is as irresponsible as making filters with holes in the media and selling them at full price knowing most consumers will never know. _________________________ 2004 Highlander 2.4 2011 Toyota Sienna 3.5 Recently Gone: 2006 Accord 2.4l K24A8 1993 Kawi EX 500

"I know the topic of IGD and sibilance with the 2M Red and more specifically the 2M Red/Pro-Ject Debut Carbon combo has been discussed on this board and many others ad nauseam , but I think I may have found a solution to many of those issues that myself and others have been having.
I will give you the short back story here; about a year ago I purchased a new Debut Carbon factory fitted with the 2M Red cart. I already had a cart that I liked very much  the AT120E/T that I planned on putting on there if the 2M did not suite my taste, however I had some high hopes for the 2M given a lot of the reviews that I read. Like many others I was very excited to hear what this new TT and cart were capable of and again like many others I was seriously disappointed. Not with the TT, in fact I must have got a good one because I dont have any of the motor noise that some complain about, but the cart sounded just terrible. So the first thing I did was break out the supplied alignment protractor and check the alignment, it appeared to be spot on so
I poured over hundreds of threads about the 2M Red and the 2M/Carbon combo and more often than not saw that others had the same complaint as I. The IGD and sibilance particularly on the last 2/3 of the side just were unlistenable on most of my records, some of them brand new and certainly none of them trashed. The advice given to others all pretty much echoed the same and that was to upgrade the cart. Some said give it time to break in, add more VTF, etc. However a few said they were completely happy with theirs so that maybe something other than the cart was at play. So after double and triple checking the alignment, azimuth, various VTF and anti-skate settings I decided that if I wanted to see what this cart was truly capable of I would need to wait it out and get past the break in period. That lasted maybe 15 hours before I just couldnt take it anymore and mounted up my AT120E/T, problem solved right? Not exactly, while the AT sounded wonderful on this table as I knew it would, I still could not get over how badly the 2M performed and I really didnt believe that Pro-Ject would have chosen this cart to supply with their TT if this was the best it could do, I knew deep down it could do much more and something was wrong. Time went on and I was enjoying the Pro-Ject so much with the AT cart that I later sold the original 2M and I thought that was the end of it. I just had given up on it.
Fast forward a few months and I am watching a video online of someone reviewing the 2M Red and giving it the utmost praise, there even were a few needle drops mixed into the video and what I heard was astonishing. I said to myself thats what I was hoping mine would sound like. So me being the vinyl addict that I am I had to give this thing another chance. Since I sold the one that came with the TT I ordered another one online. I mounted it up, meticulously aligned it and WHAMO same problems as the first. Bummer so I start thinking about the possibility of another alignment strategy. Now bear in mind that the Carbon is an 8.6 tonearm with a fixed headshell so that makes using some conventional alignments such as baerwald challenging if not impossible. I did read on another forum about Conrad Hoffmans custom arc protractor generator program and with this you can play with some of the numbers and pretty much use any alignment strategy on any TT/arm combo you like.
I followed the directions in the readme file that he provides and simply measured pivot to spindle distance, which on a Debut Carbon is 200mm and plugged that into the program and chose a standard IEC groove radius with a Lofgren A alignment. Printed it out, followed the standard procedure for using arc style protractors and got everything as perfectly aligned as my eyes would let me, set VTF to the recommended 1.8g and anti-skate weight to the middle detent and dropped the needle WOW is all I can say. This cart was finally singing like I though it always could. Night and day difference. No IGD what so ever, maybe a bit of pinch effect on the last cut but not at all distorted and thats to be expected with a standard elliptical stylus profile. Sibilants are for the most part gone and when they do occasionally present they are only on heavily modulated cuts and it is hardly noticeable unless you are really trying to pick them out .again I call this normal for basic elliptical styli. I am about 20 hours into the break in process and it just keeps getting better. Bass is authoritative, mids and highs are silky smooth, this is a very balanced cart. I do run it through a tubed phono pre, so YMMV on a solid state pre.
Here is the deal though, now I have owned many turntables and have aligned many a cart and have always aligned to the cantilever and not the cart body. For the 2M throw that out the window, there are too many lines in the body of this cart and parallax errors are almost impossible to avoid at least for my eyes. Align to the front of the cart body, use a 0.5mm pencil lead taped to the front if you need to.
I am not saying that this will fix everyone out there with this problem, I am just saying this worked for me and I suspect that it will help quite a few others with this problem. For the price this is an amazing phono cart and I plan on using it for quite a while and will be giving my AT a break, in fact it is packed back up in its box at the moment. Anyway for the cost of a sheet of paper to print out the protractor and about an hour of time I think its worth a try for anyone with similar problems. Hope this helps.
Chris"

"Simply Measured Simply Measured founders Adam Schoenfeld, Aviel Ginzburg, and Damon Cortesi capture the 2013 Startup of the Year award at the GeekWire Awards.
Simply Measured has acquired its second company in less than two months.
The Seattle social media analytics startup today announced the acquisition of DataRank , a Fayetteville, Ark.-based company that helps marketers turn social media data and online conversation into actionable insights.
Founded in 2011, DataRank had raised $1.6 million and graduated from Y Combinator in 2013. The company, which helps clients with consumer and shopper insights, brand health monitoring, and competitive analysis, grew its customer base by 150 percent over the past year.
DataRank will retain its employees and continue to work out of the Fayetteville headquarters while offering its product to existing customers. A small portion of the staff is relocating to Seattle to work for Simply Measured. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
On Sept. 1, Simply Measured acquired fellow Seattle-based startup Inside Social , a similar company to DataRank that also helps marketers track social media results. Both acquisitions enable Simply Measured to not only help marketers analyze social media traffic and determine social media influencers, but also show them which platforms provide the most value and how those strategies are paying off.
“By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we’re providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success,” Simply Measured CEO Adam Schoenfeld said in a statement.
Simply Measured, which is hosting its own conference this month, launched in 2010 and now has more than 130 employees. The company raised $20 million in 2014 after being named GeekWire’s 2013 Startup of the Year . What happens when Geeks Give Back?

"The Ultimate Mega Guide to Using Video With WordPress Multisite Tutorials By Jenni McKinnon Featuring video on your site can be a powerful way to show – and not just tell – visitors what your site is all about.
According to Simply Measured , videos have the highest shares and engagement right up there beside photos. In the first quarter of 2015 alone, video engagement increased by 43% on Facebook.
On top of that, 64% are more likely to buy a product on an online retail site after watching a video, and 70% of marketing professionals report that video converts better than any other medium.
But if you have a fantastic idea for a video, or you’ve got one already, how do you go about adding it to your site? In this definitive guide, we go through everything you need to know about video, from technical details on aspect ratios and codecs, though to self-hosted versus hosted videos, encoding videos for multiple devices, and getting started uploading videos to your WordPress site.
This is part one of a two-part series. In tomorrow’s post, we’ll review the most popular services for hosting video.
Let’s get started. Summary Common Video Terms Defined
Before we dive right into how videos work with WordPress, it might be helpful to first go through the common definitions when it comes to videos. In particular, understanding the terms used when uploading and displaying videos on your site can help eliminate confusion.
And if you think you already know video terms inside out, the definitions below may be a helpful reminder. For professional videos on your site, the 16:9 aspect ratio is usually best.
Aspect Ratio – This term is used most commonly for photos, TVs , and video.
It refers to the proportional size of the image or screen in width, then length in the form of a ratio.
For example, a common aspect ratio is 16:9 , where 16 units is for the width of the video or image and nine units is the length.
Resolution – It’s another word for the quality of the video image and can be measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or more commonly, dots per inch (DPI). These units are used to explain how many dots of color (for printed images) or how many pixels of color (for digital content) per square inch are displayed within an image or video. A higher DPI or PPI means a higher resolution and better quality. The standard for high quality (HQ) video is 300 PPI.
When it comes to displaying video, resolution is usually written in the form of width x height where width refers to the number of horizontal pixels displayed and height is the number of vertical pixels displayed on the screen.
When written in short form, it looks like height p, or to use a common example, 1080p.
Standard Definition (SD) – A common video resolution is 640×480 or 480p and is considered standard definition. A video in standard definition appears the size of an older, mostly square TV.
High Definition (HD) – Most TVs and computer monitors made today are in 1920×1080 or also known as 1080p. The picture is clear and crisp because the monitors and screen are made for videos that have a high resolution.
There are also other resolutions that are considered high definition such as 1920×720. This also includes the aspect ratios of 2.39:1 and 1.85:1 which are considered super widescreen and are commonly used for films that you can check out at your favorite movie theater.
Interlaced – An older way for video signals to display video on a screen. Signals send horizontal lines of the video to the screen which together form the moving images. Interlaced videos display every other horizontal line and switch between odd and even numbered lines.
If you still have a big box TV you bought in the 90s, videos on it will be displayed as interlaced. It was the old standard for videos. Remember the big, old TVs?
Progressive Scan – This is the new standard for videos. Video signals display each horizontal line for a richer and more high quality picture, unlike the interlaced alternate which displays every other line.
If you bought a flat screen TV or monitor since they have been first made, then you’ll own a screen that displays videos with a progressive scan.
Frame Rate – This is the speed at which a sensor captures video in a second. A single frame looks like a photograph. When you string each frame together, you get a moving picture or in other words, a video.
Frames Per Second (FPS) – This term is used to describe the number of frames used per second of a video. Common FPS include 24, 25, 29.97, 30 and 50. When you have a video that’s 30 FPS or more, it’s considered HD.
Bitrate – This indicates the amount of data that’s transferred per second when a video is being uploaded, usually measured in megabits per second (mbps) or kilobits per second (kbps).
If you find a video host that uploads videos with a bitrate of less than 1000 kbps, it’s best to search for another host since the upload process will be too slow for most people.
Compression – While this term can apply to more than just videos, in this case, it means decreasing the amount of data a video file holds.
It’s a great idea to compress your videos because they will upload to your site or your video hosting quicker. If you choose to let users download your video, this will also be a lot faster.
Each video hosting service may have different compression guidelines and suggestions so it may be worth looking into if you choose to host your videos outside of your WordPress site.
Lossy – When you are compressing a video file, a lossy compression means the quality of the video decreases when compared to the original file. Despite the lesser quality, a lossy compression usually results in a smaller file size.
Lossless – This would be the opposite of lossy when you are compressing a video file. While lossless compression means the original file and compressed file have the same video quality, this usually results in a larger file size when compared to lossy compressed files. Lossy compression is lower in quality and smaller in file size than lossless compression.
Codec – This is most commonly a method of compressing and decompressing videos. It’s also known as a container.
A software that compresses videos is also often referred to as a codec if it can both compress and decompress videos. If it can only compress videos is commonly referred to as an encoder and a software that only decompresses is usually called a decoder.
Common codecs include H.264/MPEG-4, VP6 and WMV.
Encoding – This describes the process of taking an original (source) video file and converting it from one extension to another for viewing on different devices and browsers.
For example, converting a video file called myvideo.mov to myvideo.mp4 allows the video to be uploaded and played on a WordPress site.
Since different browsers and mobile devices accept different kinds of video file formats, encoding your videos can help ensure your videos are viewable to all your visitors no matter how they choose to view your video. Uploading and Adding Video File Types to WordPress
Speaking of encoding, there are certain video file extensions that WordPress lets you upload by default. .MP4, .M4V (MPEG-4) .3GP (3GPP) .3G2 (3GPP2)
There are many files types which aren’t accepted by default for security reasons. If you don’t need a file type that’s not accepted by WordPress, it’s best just to not use it. If you try uploading a file type that’s not already programmed into WordPress, you get an error.
If you would still like to let you and your users upload more file types that aren’t allowed by default, you can do so by adding some code to the bottom of your theme’s functions.php file under wp-content > themes > your-theme .
Just remember that any changes you make to your theme’s functions.php file get erased after you install an update to your theme.
To prevent this from happening, you can create a child theme. If you need pointers on how to do this, check out our post How to Create a WordPress Child Theme .
Here’s the code you would need to add to include additional file types:
To add the file extension of your choice, change the word extension on line four to the actual file extension you would like to add, then replace mime/type with the correct mime type which you can find on the MIME Type List from FreeFormatter.com .
To add a second file extension, change doc and application/msword to your desired extension and type on line six. You can also delete this line if you only wish to add one file type.
If you would like to remove a file type from the list of accepted file types, while adding others, add this code instead:
You would add it to the same place, to the bottom of the functions.php file found under wp-content > themes > your-theme .
Just be sure to edit line eight to reflect the extension you want to remove. In this example, you would change exe to the file type you want eliminated. If you skip this step in the Network Settings after adding the code to your theme’s functions.php file, it results in an error when you try to upload the file type you wanted to add.
For Multisite installs, once you have added the code above to your theme, you need to add the file extension through the super admin dashboard > Settings > Network Settings . Under Upload File Type , enter the extension of the file you wish to add, being sure that each file type is separated with a single space.
Once you’re done adding the extensions to the list, click Save Changes at the bottom of the page.
You and your users can now upload the file types you added.
If you would prefer to avoid adding code to your theme, you can still add the file extensions you want with the WP Add Mime Types plugin or Media Library Assistant plugins. What Settings Should You Use?
Before you start uploading your videos, you might be wondering what kind of settings you should choose to ensure they display well. At the end of the day, this may look different for everyone, especially if you decide to upload to a video hosting service since each one usually has its own recommended settings.
On the other hand, if you’re self-hosting your videos, a general rule of thumb can be helpful in deciding what your settings should look like for your particular project.
These recommended from Video4Change should get you off to a good start:
Format: MP4 Frame Rate: 24, 25 or 30 (Constant) Frame Size / Resolution: 1280 x 720 (720p) Fields: Progressive Bitrate: 320 kbit/s Sample Rate: 44.100 OR 48,000 kHz (retain original sample rate)
Just keep in mind that a higher bitrate will result in a larger file size so if your goal is to keep things neat and tight, choose a bitrate closer to 5000 kilobits per second.
Now you’re almost ready to upload your videos. Self Hosted vs Hosted Videos
Before diving into the ins and outs of adding videos to your site, it’s important to first understand where your videos should be stored. To that end, there are two options: self-hosted and hosted.
Self-hosted your videos means that they’re stored on your server with your WordPress site.
Hosted option means your videos are stored elsewhere and linked or embedded to your site.
There are many reasons why you would choose one over the other and here are some pointers to help you determine which option is right for you: Do you plan on displaying many videos that are high-quality or high definition? If so, your server’s storage limit can fill up fast and it may be appropriate to host your videos elsewhere. The kind of hosting you have set up is important: Shared hosting – If you’re able to load even one high-quality video with a large file size, consider yourself lucky. Definitely consider hosting your videos somewhere else. VPS hosting – You may have enough room to store quite a few videos as long as you don’t plan on continuously adding more as time goes on. Dedicated hosting – You should be good to go and have quite a lot of room for many videos, although, depending on your set up and if you would like to add many videos over time, you may need to upgrade later on. To host videos well, you should make sure your site and server are optimized for speed – Be sure that your server has an ample amount of RAM and a fairly generous processor speed. The amount you need depends on how many videos you plan on self-hosting. As a general rule of thumb, a video that’s 1GB in size should comfortably fit into a hosting plan that has two and a half gigabytes of RAM, a minimum of a dual-core processor and 1500 MB of storage space. Make sure you have enough bandwidth allotted to your hosting package – How many visitors are you expecting? If you think your site will blow up with popularity, you should consider how much bandwidth your site is allowed to use up. The more visitors you’re expecting, the more bandwidth you’re going to need. To give you an idea of how much bandwidth you might need, a one-gigabyte video played or downloaded 1000 times needs one terabyte of bandwidth (that’s 1000 GB). If you’re planning to display many high-quality videos with tons of visits to your site, you should consider hosting your site somewhere other than your own server.
If your server doesn’t have a lot of storage space, speed and bandwidth, definitely consider hosting your videos outside of your server. If you have lots of room on your server as well as tons of speed and allotted bandwidth, but want to host heaps of videos with thousands of visitors, also consider hosting your videos somewhere other than your server.
On the other hand, if you have a server with tons of storage space, a few fast processors and lots of bandwidth giving you breathing room, you should be able to host at least quite few high resolution videos with no problems.
If you’re still not sure if you have enough resources to host your own videos, but want to, it’s a great idea to ask your hosting provider’s customer service team. They can best help you sort out the best option for your specific needs.
If you would like to look at some other reasons why you may want to host your videos elsewhere, take a look at one of our other articles called 5 Scenarios Where You Need To Ditch The WordPress Video Player . Uploading Videos to WordPress
Since the most recent WordPress updates, it hasn’t been easier to upload and showcase your videos. Now all it takes is just a few clicks and you’re ready to go.
If you have decided to self host your videos, here’s how to add them to your WordPress site. Adding Videos to Your Post or Page
In a post or page, click the Add Media button, then click the Upload Media tab at the top if you are not already on that tab when the inline pop-up opens. Uploading a video directly to a post is easy.
Then, click the Select Files button that appears in the middle of the page. You can alternatively choose an already uploaded file by selecting the Media Library tab.
Choose the video file you would like to upload and follow your computer’s prompt. There are other options available if you don’t want to embed your video.
Once the file uploads, enter a title, caption and description as desired on the right-hand side and be sure that the Embed Media Player option is selected from the Embed or Link drop down box under the Attachment Display Settings . It should be selected by default.
Finally, click the Insert into post button and your video will be added to your post or page, complete with a thumbnail. Adding a Video Playlist to a Post or Page
If you have uploaded two or more videos, you can create a playlist. Creating a video playlist is as easy as selecting videos from the list in your media library.
To do this, click the Add Media button again, select Create Video Playlist from the menu on the left hand side of the pop-up, then click on the icons for the videos you want to add.
If you make a mistake, just click the the check mark on the top, right-hand corner of the icon for the video you want to remove.
You can also click the Clear link at the bottom of the window to unselect all your choices.
Once you are done making your selections, click each video to add the title, caption and description you want on the right for each of your videos, then click the Create a new video playlist button at the bottom of the Attachment Details section.
At this point, you can edit the titles of the videos you selected, add more videos by clicking the Add to Video Playlist menu item on the left and reverse the order of your selected videos by clicking the Reverse order button beside the Playlist Settings on the right.
Under the settings, there are two checkboxes: Show Video List – This option displays your videos with a thumbnail. Show Images – Checking the box for this setting displays a text list of your videos.
When you’re done making your selections, click the Insert video playlist button on the bottom-right.
Last, but not least of all, be sure to click the Publish or Update button on your post or page to save your changes. Uploading Videos to the Media Library
If you would like to upload videos, but don’t want to insert them into a post right away, then you can do so by going to Media > Add New in your admin dashboard and clicking the Select Files button. Follow your computer’s prompts to select and upload a video. Uploading a file directly to the media library.
Once the upload has been completed, click on the file’s icon which appears on the page after the loading bar appears to complete. On the Attachment Details inline pop-up that appears, click on the Edit More Details link at the bottom. Sign up for more WordPress wisdom
Once the Edit Media page loads, you can easily customize your videos settings by editing the title, adding a caption and description. You can change many settings on the Edit Media page including setting the featured image of your video.
On this page, you should also see an preview image displayed in the player preview. If you would like to change the image that appears and set your own to display, click the Set featured image link on the bottom, right-hand side of the page.
The media uploader pop-up window should appear where you can select an image from your media library.
You can also upload a new one by clicking Upload files > Select Files , then following your computer’s prompt.
Add the title, caption, alt text and description you want, then click the Set featured image button at the button, right-hand corner.
Finally, click the Update button and your new featured image and other changes should save. Your video is now ready to be added to a post or page at your convenience.
Just remember that in order for your videos to have the option to be embedded into your posts and pages and actually be playable with the default WordPress player, your video files will need to be encoded with the MPEG-4 codec or in other words, have the .mp4 extension.
If you would like to choose a different video player, other than the default one WordPress comes with, check out our post 5 Beautiful WordPress Video Players . Advice From Our In-House Video Expert Joshua Dailey Video guy Joshua Dailey.
I asked our videographer Joshua Dailey his advice when working with video, and in particular what advice he would give to businesses working with video.
Joshua directs, writes and scripts the product videos here at WPMU DEV and has help from other talented videographers on our team.
“We are working to give users a better understanding of WPMU DEV products and WordPress so they can make quicker, informed decisions about what products will best fit their needs.” – Joshua Dailey “With our tutorials, we are trying to help people get started as quickly as possible.” – Joshua Dailey
Here’s Joshua’s top 10 list for UI and UX best practices, in no particular order: 1. Find the Right Host
It’s important to find one that can accommodate all of your needs before you upload over 100 videos. Whether that’s self-hosting, free hosting or premium hosting, make sure your host not only meets your current needs, but can and is willing to grow to meet your future needs.
Moving WPMU DEV from Vimeo to Wistia was a lot of work. It was worth it, but it would have saved a lot of time and money had we found them first. You can learn more about the transitioning process in our article Why We Moved From Vimeo Pro to Wistia – And Why You Should Too . 2. Videos Need to be Encoded
Make sure you videos are encoded correctly. First, for the best results, but second, for playback on all types of devices. This is something you may not initially think about if you’re self-hosting your videos.
If you have only ever used YouTube, Vimeo or Wistia, they reencode your media so your videos work on all types of devices – in all types of browsers. When self-hosting you may need to store multiple versions of the same video in different formats or you may not be able to view your video depending on the browser or device they are using. 3. A World-Wide Audience Should Have Equal Access
If your site targets users from around the world, remember that internet speeds can make it near impossible for some of your users to access heavy video content. This is improving all the time, but we are far from having equal access, globally.
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use video since it’s a powerful form of communication, but it does mean you should be aware of who your audience is when sharing. It’s also important to make sure you’re using an appropriate player and compression method. 4. Presentation Matters
It’s easy for your users to skip clicking on a video based on the thumbnail alone. Remember, video thumbnails matter. Always test the performance of your videos. 5. Test Your Videos for Performance
Try your crazy ideas but know when they are working and when they’re not. We spend a lot of time creating videos, sharing them internally and adjusting content before pushing them live. This is an important step in ensuring each member in your audience has equal and full access to your videos. 6. Know Your Audience
Once a video is published, we spend time watching how users interact with our content and make even more adjustments if needed. For example, we did some long, in-depth video tutorials about our plugins, but found short setup guides to be more accessible to more viewers.
Thanks to tracking viewer engagement with analytics, we were able to determine what our audience prefers, especially since it’s not the same across all businesses. 7. Keep a Close Eye On Quality
Audio done well often goes unnoticed and audio done poorly tricks viewers into believing the whole video is trash. Be careful when using video as a sales tool because the quality of your videos reflects on the quality of your product or service. 8. Plan Your Video Marketing Thoroughly
Customers and end users equate the quality of your marketing to the quality of your product even if it’s not an accurate reflection. Having a solid marketing strategy helps keep your end user happy with your business. 9. Videos Should be Accessible to Everyone
According to preliminary research from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey an estimated 20.6 million adult Americans have been reported as having trouble seeing, even with the aid of glasses and contacts or are legally blind.
Gallaudet University in Washington, DC has also reported that an anywhere from nine to 22 out of every 1000 Americans have a severe hearing impairment or are legally deaf.With these numbers in mind, it’s important to make sure your videos are accessible to individuals who can identify as having these impairments.
Uploading closed captioning documents to your videos helps those who are hearing impaired to view your videos with ease. Similarly, including a transcript of your videos assists those who are visually impaired to access your videos. Have you ever wondered how easy it is for people with disabilities to access your site and then navigate around it?
Making sure your video player includes keyboard navigation and support for screen readers are also important. All videos should play only when the play button is clicked or otherwise accessed with a keyboard to be considered accessible.
If your videos play automatically on page load, they aren’t accessible and you should adjust your settings.
Not to mention the plain idea that videos that play automatically can often be startling, especially when your users aren’t aware of where the sound is suddenly coming from or if the volume is set to be high.It’s also a drain on most end user’s internet bill since they need to pay for streaming videos.
It may not be a huge concern for desktop users at home or in the office, but mobile users often have a much smaller and limited data plan with their carrier and each played video ends up costing them. This is why you should consider leaving out your video backgrounds, if only for mobile themes, as well as eliminate videos which play automatically. 10. Responsive Design and Style
Part of keeping your videos accessible to all your users is making sure that they’re responsive on screens of different sizes from browsers to mobile devices. This can be easily achieved with a responsive player, a video host or some CSS.
With these tips in mind, let’s look at how you can embed videos that are encoded across multiple devices and how to make your videos responsive for self-hosted videos. Encoding Your Videos for Multiple Devices
As Josh has mentioned, it’s easy to forget that self-hosted videos require you to encode them yourself since it’s not done automatically, such as with the many video hosting options out there. Browsers and mobile devices often have different requirements when it comes to the video compression methods that are able to be displayed.
Before we dive into the code you can customize to display your videos properly across multiple devices and browsers, let’s take a look at which compression methods work best for the different options out there.
Here’s an overview of the top browsers and mobile devices, and the types of best supported video compression: Browser"

Dear Undummy, I read your posts regularly. You write very knowledgably about transmissions. I assume you work in this field. So, my spouse has a 2000 Volvo S70, AT, 83,000 miles (ATF is JWS 3309 spec) I never did any transmission maintenance (following the owner's manual guidance) before I learned about the negative consequences of lifetime fluids and longevity of a part. I started feeling that the shifts were a bit more noticeable (never bad) last year and requested a flush from the Volvo dealership. They decided to do a drain/clean pan/fill and drain a couple of times since the Volvo ATF (JWS 3309) is $$$. That was fine with me. Shifting was back to its usual almost imperceptible feel. So, I want to start doing an annual drain and fill. I read this is just under 3.7 qts (or liters, I'll look again). After finally finding the very stubby dipstick, the opening looks very small. My questions: 1. I like the idea of using the same fluid presently in the transmission since I will not be changing all of it (it will be about half from what I read). I don't like the Volvo ATF expense, but I'm willing to use. I know that Mobil has a JWS 3309 spec, but I cannot find on the internet who makes the Volvo stuff. Do you think looking for the Mobil 3309 is fine for this purpose? 2. From what I read on some Volvo forums, I replace the fluid thru the dipstick. 3. I don't know if you are familiar with the 850/S70 series, but I noticed a large bolt head staring right at me when I look at the transmission from above. I have one socket that's big (25 mm) and this bolt is not quite that large, but almost. I wonder if that's a fill plug. That would make life easier. 4. My plan is to simply measure what comes out and put that amount back in. I am not a mechanic; I have just learned to do a few simple things over the years. Please make comments/recommendations. Thank you.

The Triad Buying and selling Formulation is a sophisticated 3 half buying and selling system developed by Jason Fielder, a veteran Foreign exchange expert of many years. A day trader ought to give attention to buying and promoting highly liquid stocks, because it hinges on the ability to purchase stocks and promote the same within seconds to minutes. Stocks that have larger liquidity could be longed and shorted at a good worth. The distinction between the bid and the ask value is called unfold and it depends upon the level of supply, demand, and trading activity for the stock. Better liquidity also reduces slippage, which is the difference between the expected worth of a commerce and the value at which it truly executes. These safeguards make regulated brokers a highly enticing proposition, nevertheless, there are lots of unregulated brokers who also present a incredible service, and are really worth contemplating. We advocate that you research a dealer before signing up with them. We check and review each of our advisable brokers completely before presenting them to you, no matter their regulatory status. As soon as they've been examined and permitted, they're added to our lists of accredited brokers. Each broker that is presented to you at TradersAsset is dedicated to offering a protected buying and selling environment and a fantastic, seamless buying and selling experience. These are three very simple guidelines that any foreign exchange trader can implement virtually immediately throughout many pairs, with no reliance on technical indicators or difficult systems. Anyone can perceive these rules. A dealer can use simple moving averages to find out the primary trend. Having no nearby assist or resistance nearby is likely to be something like a hundred pips minimum, or probably extra, and you'll write this into your guidelines. Currency strength or weak point will be simply measured on entry using The Forex Heatmap®. Start testing these guidelines first by demo buying and selling. Foreign exchange traders that are utilizing rule based mostly techniques now are nearly at all times using technical indicators, so their rules are primarily based on the indications. This leads to frustration and no pips. Move on shortly from the technical indicators and set up guidelines that don't depend on indicators. Any forex system that makes use of rules with technical indicators on the basis will at all times fail. Establishing trading guidelines includes eliminating rules that are not providing results. Each foreign exchange dealer knows technical indicators present hundreds of mixtures but the pips are merely not there. But another Mr. Y decides to purchase Australian dollars not as a result of he's in search of a sojourn on the Gold Coast, however because they're out there at charge which he believes will increase. Confused? Let me explain with the help of an instance. Suppose in the present day Mr Y can purchase ASD3 in alternate for USD1, and only https://youtu.be/6LS2nr_1Fe0 - Live trading room - for a second, assume that he can promote them tomorrow for USD2, he's going to make a tidy little profit of USD1 on what's broadly often known as the International Alternate (Forex) Market. However why will the price of ASD3 jump from USD1 to USD2? Because of the fluctuations within the demand and provide of assorted currencies within the Forex market.

"¿Cuán saludable es usted?
How Healthy Are You? (English version below…)

Hay algo que decir para comenzar por el principio, cuando el establecimiento de metas de salud y fitness. Llevar a su estado actual en cuenta le ayudará a establecer metas más realistas, aumentando así sus posibilidades de éxito.

Por ejemplo, tener exceso de peso alrededor del abdomen es un potente factor de riesgo para múltiples enfermedades crónicas, como la diabetes y enfermedades del corazón. Esto también se conoce como la obesidad en forma de manzana clásica.

Para determinar la relación entre altura y cintura, simplemente medir su altura y la circunferencia de su cintura con una cinta métrica. Su circunferencia de la cintura debe ser inferior a la mitad de su altura. Como ejemplo, si usted es de seis pies de alto (72 pulgadas), la circunferencia de la cintura debe ser idealmente menos de 36 pulgadas.

Para determinar la relación cintura-cadera, obtener una cinta de medir y registrar su cintura y la circunferencia de la cadera. Luego divide la circunferencia de la cintura por la circunferencia de la cadera.

Cintura a cadera      Hombres            Mujeres
Ideal                               0,8                      0,7
Bajo Riesgo              <0,95                    <0,8
Riesgo moderado  0,96 a 0,99   desde 0,81 hasta 0,84
Alto Riesgo               > 1.0                    > 0.85

--------------------

How Healthy Are You...

There's something to be said for starting at the beginning when setting health and fitness goals. Taking your current status into account will help you set more realistic goals, thereby boosting your chances of success.

For example, carrying excess weight around your midsection is a potent risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease. This is also known as the classic apple-shaped obesity.

To determine your height-to-waist ratio, simply measure your height and your waist circumference with a measuring tape. Your waist circumference should be less than half of your height. As an example, if you're six feet tall (72 inches), your waist circumference should ideally be less than 36 inches.

To determine your waist-to-hip ratio, get a tape measure and record your waist and hip circumference. Then divide your waist circumference by your hip circumference.

Waist to Hip Ratio Men   Women
Ideal                          0.8             0.7
Low Risk                <0.95   <0.8
Moderate Risk      0.96-0.99  0.81 - 0.84
High Risk                 >1.0           >0.85 null"

"12 Memes Only Social Media Marketers Will Understand 2015-08-18T16:08:43+00:00 Jade Furubayashi Blogger Extraordinaire Simply Measured
Nobody understands the rollercoaster of emotions a misspelled Tweet causes or the excitement that that little blue check inspires like a social media marketer.
People don’t understand why you have to slink away from your friends at 10PM on a Friday to respond to a Facebook post or why people know you not by name but by Twitter handle…but we do.
The plight of the social media marketer cannot be summed up in words, so we tried to do it in memes. Enjoy and click to Tweet!
We put these memes together to remind you social media marketers that you’re not alone out there.
The best way to handle your most common problems is to start with analytics, so you can double down on what’s proven to be successful and save yourself time, resources, and headaches (and get back to that party).
Don’t get left behind.
Put #AnalyticsFirst.
And remember, you can always Tweet into @SimplyMeasured for comforting words of social support and fresh memes 24/7! + Jade Furubayashi My name's Jade and I'm a social media addict from Seattle, WA.

"Tweet
What do your leaders celebrate in your workplace? Take a moment and write down the five to 10 things that leaders measure, praise, encourage, recognize, or reward on a regular basis.
Don’t look at service awards or other annual recognition that are given out. Note down the day-to-day messages that team members hear.
Next, categorize these messages, rewards, and praisings. Note which rewards are about results, performance and money, and which rewards are about cooperative interaction, citizenship and kindness.
I’ll wager you’ll have a majority of those messages categorized as performance-related. I wouldn’t be surprised if you had 80% or more of the rewards in your workplace focused on performance and results.
Don’t get me wrong — I love results! Performance, results, and profits are definitely important. They help your enterprise survive .
However, what makes your enterprise thrive is the quality of your work environment. A healthy workplace means that everyone in the organization — and even customers — are treated with trust, dignity, and respect in every interaction.
The challenge is that most leaders have not been asked to manage the quality of their work environment. They may not know how! Their previous and current bosses — their role models — simply measured, monitored, managed and rewarded results. So, that’s exactly what they do — they focus on results.
And, typically, the daily messages those leaders communicate reinforce the importance of results, the measurement of results, etc. And, if all you’re measuring is results, people may choose to go to extremes to deliver them.
They may throw tantrums. They may be mean. They may yell. They may undermine others’ efforts. They may withhold vital information, and worse. Just so they win while their peers lose.
I don’t think leaders intend to create unhealthy work environments. I’m convinced that leaders assume that their people will be nice to each other.
Treating peers and customers with trust, dignity, and respect is common sense, right? Everybody knows how they should behave. Yet, some don’t behave nicely. They serve themselves, not others.
The problem with common sense is it ain’t very common. In the absence of clear expectations, us humans don’t always play nice.
If leaders want both high performance and workplace trust and respect, they must demand it. They must formalize not only expected results but also expected values and citizenship.
They must craft an organizational constitution that specifies the team’s (or company’s) present day purpose, values and behaviors, strategies, and goals.
Then leaders must hold everyone, including themselves, accountable for both results and for tangible, measurable valued behaviors.
Don’t rely on common sense. Create common goals and shared values, then reinforce them daily. Your organization will thrive .
What do you think? What percentage of the messages team members hear in your company focus on results? To what extent does your company define and demonstrate values and behaviors? Share your thoughts about this post/podcast in the comments section below.

Catching up this week on another acquisition by Simply Measured, a tie-up of two Northwest angel investing groups, a milestone for “conscious company incubator” Fledge, funding for mobile app developer AppSheet, a new technology licensing program from NASA, and news from Spaceflight, Allrecipes, and Impinj. Details:
— Simply Measured , a Seattle-based social media analytics company, made its second acquisition in recent weeks, scooping up Fayetteville, AR-based DataRank, which helps companies gather data and act on social media activity. The DataRank buy—terms undisclosed—follows its acquisition in September of Inside Social , which helps calculate the return on investments in social media marketing. “Basing campaign decisions on passive listening and vanity metrics is no longer enough to show social ROI or justify the investment to CMOs,” said Simply Measured CEO Adam Schoenfeld in a news release. “Marketers need real social intelligence and research to discover new opportunities, understand online conversation, and take action. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we’re providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success.” Simply Measured raised $20 million in 2014.
—Two Seattle-area angel investing groups are combining. Keiretsu Forum Northwest has acquired assets of the ZINO Society , which closed its doors after 10 years. ZINO’s founder and CEO Cathi Hatch has become president of the Keiretsu Forum’s Seattle chapter. ZINO Society members will “have access to the extensive Keiretsu Forum network of high quality deal flow and due diligence collaboration,” Hatch said in a news release.
— Fledge , a Seattle-based accelerator for startups addressing social problems while pursuing profits, is marking $1 million invested in 39 companies since opening in 2012 . The companies—which participated in six classes over the last three years consisting of 10 weeks of training and mentorship culminating in a demo day —have raised a combined $10 million in additional funding and created more than 300 jobs, Fledge said. A single company, BURN Manufacturing, raised $4 million in 2013 .
“Fledge is proving that it is possible for startups to do good, by doing business, and not just Seattle or just American startups, but startups from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa,” Fledge founder Michael “Luni” Libes said in a news release. Indeed, its most recent class consisted entirely of companies based in Africa and South America . Many Fledge startup companies are focused on the basic needs of people in the developing world: BURN’s clean-burning cook stoves, for example, or cold storage for small farmers. “A few of the fledglings are already profitable, which shouldn’t be surprising, as profits come from solving problems,” Libes said.
—The University of Washington’s 33rd president is Ana Mari Cauce , a psychology professor and administrator who is also the consummate insider, having worked for the UW for nearly 30 years. Cauce, who was interirm president for the last seven months, gave her annual address this week, saying she has no intention of “fundamentally changing the course of our university.” She added, “My aim isn’t to start a bunch of new things and do them in small ways. Instead, let’s use our culture, our way of working together, to make real progress on the big things that truly make a difference.” Her full speech is here .
— AppSheet , a Seattle startup, announced a $1.5 million seed investment, led by New Enterprise Associates, to bankroll a platform for making mobile apps using data. The twist, the company says, is that anyone who can build a spreadsheet can make an app with its tools, which ingest structured data to automatically generate apps capable of a range of functions , such as managing a media budget, collecting field survey data, or taking inventory. The company says it has had some 30,000 people create apps using its tools since launching last November.
—NASA has technologies and wants startup companies to make use of them . NASA’s Technology Transfer Program is making some 1,200 patented technologies available to young businesses for no up-front licensing payments, and no minimum fees for three years. The licenses are not exclusive, but exclusive agreements can be negotiated. The patented technologies are grouped into 15 categories including: sensors, propulsion, power generation and storage, materials and coatings, aeronautics, IT and software, and optics.
— Spaceflight unit Spaceflight Networks , which is building a communications system for small satellites, has switched on a new ground station in New Zealand. It’s the third such station in what Spaceflight intends to be a global network for communicating with and controlling satellites. “The small-satellite revolution requires massive improvements in latency, data throughput and operating costs compared to what is available today,” said Spaceflight CEO Jason Andrews in a news release. “Bringing the ground station online in New Zealand is another step in executing on our vision to add more capacity across more continents to satisfy the tremendous customer demand.” [ Andrews will speak about Seattle’s role as a hub for entrepreneurship in a new era of commercial space business at Seattle 2035 on Oct. 30—Eds. ]
—Seattle-based Allrecipes is teaming with Instacart, which delivers groceries to shoppers’ homes, to allow on-demand delivery of ingredients for select recipes. “This partnership will allow people to search and pull up their favorite recipes on their devices and have everything needed to make that meal delivered to their doorstep on-demand,” said Vishwa Chandra, vice president of retail accounts at Instacart, in a news release .
—Impinj, which marked the sale of its 10 billionth radio frequency identification (RFID) chip earlier this year and is celebrating 15 years in business, announced a new brand and logo , and opened its new South Lake Union headquarters.

Google Social-media marketing can be overwhelming for anyone, especially small-business owners and solo entrepreneurs. There’s a lot of pressure to be everywhere at once -- to be fully active on every social-media site out there. Of course, this isn’t realistic. Social-media marketing takes time. Fortunately, there are several ways you can save significant amounts of time as you work to spread the word about your business. Here’s how to save at least two hours per week on your social-media-marketing efforts: Be choosy. Consistency is absolutely key on social media. A company with a spotty presence on a social-media site sends a message of unprofessionalism and sloppiness. If you want to build trust and relationships with your prospects on social media, you need to have a consistent, professional image. It gets worse if your brand message is inconsistent on social media compared to your website and other outlets. Do you use the same images, taglines and colors on all of your profiles? Is your tone and timing consistent? Do you respond, or not respond, the same way all of the time? If not, you’re damaging your brand’s image . You need your presence to be familiar to prospects if you want to turn them into customers. The way to make sure your presence, content quality and brand message are consistently excellent, without losing your mind, is to be choosy when it comes to your social-media platforms. Focus on no more than one to three platforms where you know your most profitable prospects are active (and don’t forget to include specialized forums in addition to sites such as Facebook and Twitter). Be relentlessly exceptional on those platforms. Ignore the rest. You’ll improve your results and save tons of time. Time saved: 30 minutes per week Know the best times for each platform. If you’re going to optimize your social-media-marketing campaigns, you have to be sure that everything you share packs a punch. One of the best ways to do this is to know the most impactful times to share. Here are some quick takeaways to help you: Pinterest has a different trending topic each day of the week. Research shows that Mondays are great for fitness shares and Tuesday is best for technology, for instance. Schedule Pinterest shares for the day that most closely matches your industry. The right times to post on Twitter will depend on what times most of your followers are online. Use Followerwonk to analyze your followers for free so you can set schedules that make the most sense for your brand. Optimal days to post to Facebook are Thursday and Friday , specifically between 1 and 3 p.m. Instagram, although it has a smaller audience, has a very high level of engagement, making it a great place for motivated brands. Only 23 percent of all Internet users are on Instagram, but the site has more than six times the interaction rate of Facebook. The best days to post to Instagram are Monday and Wednesday, although all weekdays are typically good. As a caveat, though, remember that general guidelines such as these don’t apply universally. Use them as starting points, but carefully monitor your analytics to be sure that the times and days you’ve chosen really are best. Optimize your posting schedule around these opportunities, and you’ll easily save time by not posting when you aren’t likely to see high engagement. Time saved: 10 minutes per week Use the right tools. Having the right tools can make all the difference between spending hours on social media and spending minutes on it. Some companies feel that using automation tools lessens their authenticity and personalization, but it doesn’t have to. By combining the right tools with a real-time presence, you can save time and money on your social-media marketing. Interestingly, Sprout Social found that businesses need to respond quickly on social media -- within 60 minutes -- to keep customers happy, even though many brands aren’t replying at all. A whopping five in six messages that need responses aren’t answered. The right monitoring tools can help build your reputation as a brand that’s quick to answer, without having to camp out on social media all day. There are a variety of great options available. Automating your social-media posts can also make a big difference in how much time it takes to manage your social-media-marketing campaign every day. Buffer , in particular, is a great choice for this. Once set up, Buffer allows for automated posting for a large variety of platforms, and will even integrate your ideal posting schedule from Followerwonk to create your Twitter queue. The platform also provides content suggestions, helping you to post regularly to each of your profiles. Finally, Buffer includes some basic analytics that’ll help you determine which posts performed the best. By using a single option for all of these needs, you’ll save time and avoid headaches. Finally, you need the right tools to help you build your following. No, I’m most definitely not talking about those spammy “buy a million followers” sites. I’m talking about targeted followers who really care about what you have to say. I love using Narrow for this purpose on Twitter. The software makes it effortless to interact with users who are likely to enjoy my products and services, which saves me a massive amount of time when it comes to building an engaged follower base. Time saved: 20 minutes per week Analyze your results. Too many companies have too little direction on their social-media marketing -- that is, other than “build engagement” and hope for the best. In reality, you’re wasting countless hours if you’re not focusing your efforts on your most effective types of posts. The only way to know what kind of content is most effective for your brand is to test, test and test some more. I’m a huge advocate of A/B testing in all areas of life, and especially in my businesses . By using A/B testing, you can find out what marketing messages resonate best with your audience, where your biggest conversions come from and what times are best for you to share. It’s all about trying it out and recording the results. Besides Buffer, there are other tools that allow you to view metrics for your social-media shares. Social Bakers and Simply Measured are both good choices, because they give you detailed results over several platforms. They also allow you to keep an eye on what your competitors are doing, another important way of staying on top of your social media marketing results. Time saved: 10 minutes per week Use data to create viral content. There’s nothing that delights a marketer’s heart like seeing a piece of social-media content go viral. Unfortunately, it feels a bit like winning the lottery: we don’t know why it happens, it just seems to fall out of the sky. But that’s an illusion. In reality, you can use data to help you create viral content. Remember that “viral” doesn’t have to mean “broke the Internet.” A widely-spread piece of content can make a big difference for your company, even if it never reaches the height of #GangnamStyle or “the dress.” By paying attention to the reasons people share content, you can create content pieces that are more likely to go viral than others. Here are a few examples: Scientific American found that content that aroused positive emotions was more shared than pieces that gave rise to negative emotions. Of the negative emotions, anger-arousing content was shared more than sad content. Though, overall, the stronger the emotional response, the more likely it was to get shared. BuzzSumo found that readers of news publications such as The Guardian were more likely to share “why”-based content, which was almost last in shares for social site BuzzFeed’s audience. The readers of BuzzFeed preferred to share list posts, which was second to last for Guardian readers. The lesson here is that you need to learn what type of audience you have before you know what type of content will work best for them. Don’t forget that the more social-media followers you have, and the more engaged they are, the more likely you are to be able to achieve viral content. YG Entertainment, which released the famous "Gangnam Style" video, already had a following of 2.5 million on YouTube before the video went live. The video launch was preceded by a series of tweets from a huge celebrity and gossip site. "Gangnam Style" wasn’t an accident -- it was well-orchestrated. Learn from Buzzfeed’s “ The Dress ”: controversy and strong opinions never fail to get people talking. When you use data to create content that’s more likely to go viral, you save yourself all the time and energy you’d otherwise spend creating duds that never get shared at all. Time saved: 40 minutes per week Mobilize brand advocates to save time. There’s nothing like having your advertising done for you to save you time. Fortunately, it’s easy to save hours each week by having someone else do your social-media marketing -- for free. How? By mobilizing brand advocates. Brand advocates are delighted customers and enthusiastic employees who take the initiative to share information about your brand with their own networks. By encouraging this kind of activity, you can save a tremendous amount of time and reach people that your brand might never have otherwise engaged. Start building your brand advocacy with passionate employees. Studies at Dell and Cisco showed that there was only a 2 to 8 percent overlap between employee and company social networks. When employees share your brand message, they’re dramatically expanding your reach. The next step is to encourage your delighted customers to talk about their experiences with your company on their profiles. Give them access to review sites, and make it easy for them to share key information. Research shows that brand advocates are 83 percent more likely to share information than the average Internet user, so you likely won’t have to push much. You’ll save a lot of time, while boosting your brand image significantly. Time saved: 10 minutes per week Saving hours every week on social-media marketing isn’t as hard as it sounds. By being choosy, knowing the best times to post, using great tools and analyzing your results, you’ll get the most out of social media. Using data to create viral content and mobilizing brand advocates will help you extend the reach of your social-media campaigns without increasing the time you spend. Altogether? That could add up to far more than two hours a week of time saved.

"The bathroom scale FRIEND or FOE?

Learn why......

Tracking your weight is helpful, but alone it’s not enough. Instead of obsessing over the reading on the scale, you should shift your focus to body composition: Your ratio of fat to muscle. Body composition is one of the best ways to judge your progress.

Even if you’re not an athlete or bodybuilder, you should still set goals to develop and maintain muscle not only for how it looks, but also for what it does for your metabolism, your strength, your health and even your confidence.

The scale is not your enemy – it can be your good friend if you know how to use the numbers as part of the feedback you need to gauge progress and make course corrections. Getting emotional about what the scale says without considering body composition is where the trouble begins. Body weight alone can fool you.

How the scale lies to you, part 1: weight and fat are not the same

First and most important, the scale lies to you because it doesn’t tell you how much of your weight is fat and how much is muscle. The scale simply measures total body weight: fat, muscle, bone, organs, blood, water, digestive system contents, glycogen, everything!

Most scale-focused dieters assume that weight loss is good and weight gain is bad. But what if the weight you gain is 100% pure muscle? Isn’t that good?

What if fifty-percent of the weight you lost was muscle (which can easily happen if you don’t use strategies to build and feed muscle while you’re losing weight). Would you celebrate cannibalizing half of your own muscle tissue? Of course not.

Remember:

Muscle is the weight you want to keep (or build). Fat is the weight you want to shed.

After using awful tea balls for way too long, I found this great little tea pot to use with my loose leaf tea. I love that there is not more worrying about the tea ball coming undone or popping open and having to strain your tea. I love the sleek look of this tea pot. I love being able to see the color changes as the tea steeps in the glass. It is so easy to simply measure your tea leaves, dump them in the steeper, time the steep, and then remove the leaves. Very rarely to I did a stray tea leaf in my cup. I can't believe I waited so long to order one of these amazing tea pots.

I'm not going to waste my time defending myself against you, as there's already plenty of proof here to the contrary of your statement. mazariamonti said: ↑ ZaXoFF7 said: ↑ The_Raucous_Messiah said: ↑ Sure is March 2012 in here. I... I can't even begin to explain why this is an absolutely terrible way of thinking. Click to expand... Really? I wasn't implying the idea that "Oh if you enjoy it then it's a good game." There are plenty of games that I enjoy that are total suck. But I feel people go too far. I deal with this sort of thing all the time on the Final Fantasy boards, where many fans are as fickle as can possibly be. One mistake and Square is suddenly worse than Activision. But ten seconds later they're 'teh shizz' again. If you genuinely enjoyed an experience, you shouldn't treat it like dirt. And unfortunately, a lot of people treat ME3 like dirt, and often (as the initial post suggest) the whole series. Why? That's hypocritical and stupid. @mazariamonti Well, by game feel I meant how it controls; that's what game feel means. It's smooth, easily controllable, doesn't fight you, and feels good to play. It's intuitive and has controls that quickly become second nature. That's great game feel. As for everything else, you basically drove my point home. As I said, it may not be as good as some other top-notch titles. But that's like saying that the Farrari 458 isn't as good as the Lamborghini Aventador or the Bugatti Veyron. That may be true, but it's still a fricking supercar; it's still better than most anything you throw against it on a track. ME3 is -as you yourself said- a AAA title. AAA isn't simply measured by popularity, but by an extremely high minimum quality rating. It means that, even if it's not the best AAA title, it's almost guaranteed to be better in most ways than titles measured by lower standards. I get that ME3's shortcoming hurt more because it is a AAA title. It was supposed to be a behemoth that demolished all of our expectations of worlds, characters and storytelling in gaming. And it wasn't. But it being a 'mediocre AAA title' does not make it a mediocre game in general. When compared to your average game, it was still a better game. I dunno, maybe you've just never played a legitimately mediocre game, like Crackdown, or Fable. And maybe you've never played a truly bad game, like Sonic 06, DBZ: Kinnect, or Last Rebellion. Regardless, Mass Effect 3 wasn't a bad game, or even a mediocre game outside of its upper eschelon peers. When looking at games as a whole, it was a great game... With probably the most rushed and crappy ending this side of Halo 2. But that's only part of the story; a part many other people blow out of proportion. Click to expand... You said that everything besides the story was "fantastic", i said otherwise, i really don't know how that "drove your point home". And despite the story not being the only important thing in a game, in Mass Effect it and the Characters (which also had major problems) are the most important things, and ill say it again, large sections of the story are bad, not just the ending, the beginning, everything having to do with the crucible, cerberus, and kai leng, and the last three hours. You're completely ignoring half of the things that i'm saying and acting like i think the only bad part of the game is the ending or something. It is a mediocre game, not a mediocre AAA title, just a mediocre game in general. It has major shortcomings in the plot and for the characters, and very little upside to make up for it. To answer your question before, no i did not enjoy it more than i thought it was "tedious or crappy", i thought the majority of the game was good for about ten hours until i decided to beat it again, where i then began to notice the flaws without my mind being clouded. It's been almost a year since then and my opinion has changed very little. Click to expand... I did NOT say that everything outside of the story was fantastic. I made a clear and concise list of things that I believed were done really well. And your rebuttal for a lot of them was "It was average for a AAA title." How does that equate to them not being great? That is literally like saying that they were about as good as every other great game does it. Revolutionary? Not hardly. Mediocre? Obviously not. I'm not ignoring anything you're saying, and I'm not pretending that you only hate the ending. And I'm also not saying that you have to see it my way. But I feel that you're doing a bit of nitpicking. Some of the problems with the game hurt you so badly that you went on a witch hunt, searching for every problem you could find. That is fine as long as this is the way you treat every game that you expect to love. Why? Because I'm positive that they all have just as many, and just as severe problems as ME3. Maybe not the same ones, but they're just as flawed. My entire point from the beginning here is keeping things in perspective (which I tend to say a lot, I just realized). Imagine if I asked you and everyone else, what they would feel if the ending to the ME series wasn't going to exactly be awesome (referring to the whole game) before ME3 came out I can guarantee that most people would've said they'd be disappointed, but as long as it was fun, it wouldn't be the end of the world; they wouldn't abandon ME and Bioware. Or what about this. Say all of the loudest people who actually know why the game/ending has flaws, kept their mouths shut about it. Do you think there would still be an outcry? I think that for the most part it would have gone by without much fuss. Too many people hear such ideas, and freely adopt them as their own. And it's made worse (as the initial post once again proves) when people go in expecting something to be bad; they search for flaws first, and play second. I'm not saying that this is what you did. But you're letting it cloud your vision of other games you compare it to. Take ME2 for instance. Honestly, it's entire overarching plot was useless padding. It was like a fricking sitcom, where none of the info you're given matters much outside of the one episode. The entire idea of the Collectors was useless, and had no real bearing on anything. After ME1, we were all excited to start preparing for a Reaper war. And instead we got some new enemy who -while they have to do with the Reapers- were honestly only there to show Cerberus; an organization who was more of a side plot at best. Many of the events that happened were great. But that doesn't matter when the entire second game was filler. Combine that with just as cliche writing as ME3, and a battle system which is the same as ME3, but less refined, and ME2 isn't exactly much more than a 'mediocre' game either. But you'd dissagree with that right? Because often, the sum of the parts are worth more than when they're separated. I personally feel that ME2 is the worst in the series, but it's still a great experience. Only ME1 comes even close to being a favorite game of mine, but it still has many flaws, including that half of the game is nothing more than ally-hunting. Again, I just feel you're being unfairly hard on ME3, because you haven't looked at other games through the same microscope.

@jjboggs Value isn't simply measured in innings. Value can be measured in how badly does a team need him given the amount of time left.
Quote from BabyLady The next time you pull one out...look CLOSELY at the tip...you will see that it is slightly rounded...that is how you know the tip is intact. If it is not it will look similar to the tip of an IV catheter...cut off. No microscope needed. If you are not checking the tip and just measuring it...then you are not doing your job (and in my opinion, not charting clearly) either because if just the tip has broke off you won't pick up on that if you just simply measure it, as the tip is too small..you have to LOOK at it. We chart the length it was put in, we chart what the length was when we started the removal and look to make sure all the numbers are there and chart, "PICC line secured at 6 cm removed with tip intact." In fact, this is the policy of how to chart it. You are incorrect that charting "tip intact" sets you up for a lawsuit. The tip is THE END. That is pretty definitive. The PICC lines that we use in our unit, the markings are clear, so there is no question of where it is. So that is why the MD didn't feel the need to measure it...because the tip condition is visible to the naked eye. Well, I too believe that the tip should be inspected, BUT, the tip is NOT always rounded my friend. Sometimes PICC's are cut to alleviate extra catheter outside of the IV site. And charting TIP intact is not appropriate.. IN a court of law, they WILL quiz you on how that determination was made. They will say... "and how is it that you were able to tell that the tip was intact?" "Microscope" etc. So, charting, "Tip intact to the Naked eye, tip straight across, or rounded, or angled" (not that angling is done that much) is a better way to chart it. However, we can agree to disagree. And, the MD didn't feel like he should measure it, because many MD's aren't infusion savy. Sad, but true.

"There's no fancy electronics here. The temp gauge simply measures coolant temperature. If it acts up when the gauge reads low, then sure enough, your temperature is low. A stuck open tstat could keep you from warming up , although it is summer...
You can unplug the o2 sensor (the fat green wire with the single spade) and just stay in open loop. Assuming proper tune, this should run absolutely fine.
Since it is summer, you could try shunting the CTS (some don't recommend this since there should still be some resistance when warm, but I've never had any issues doing this. *AT YOUR OWN RISK*) to simulate a warm condition (note it will run lean until it warms up)."

"Some time ago, I posted I'd be having my DNA 'done', and I'd post recommendations here. So here's an update.
I'm still waiting on mitochondrial (mt) DNA, but I have y-chromosome data.
mt-DNA is short (a tad over 13,000 base pairs) and so you can just have them sequence the damn thing. The Y chromosome, though it's small as chromosomes go, is a bit big for a cheap full sequence (58 million base pairs), so DNA sequence analysis looks for two things: STRs (short tandem repeats) and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).
STRs are short regions in the non-coding DNA that get repeated multiple times in sequence. So, for example, DYD393 is a AGAT sequence repeated 9 - 17 times in a row, on a particular region of the chromosome. Because of a foible of DNA replication, any particular STR can be reduced or increased in number, maybe every 100 generations, or even more rapidly. So standard genealogical analysis simply measures the repeat number of up to 111 STRs. Because the time period is so short, this gives you genealogical data on a timescale of a few generations. So, searching the data base, I find I'm identical to a Christopher T Harbison, an MD living in Los Angeles, on the 11 most frequently tested STRs, and one repeat number away from a Bruce Raymond Harbison of Tampa Florida, on a 37 STR test. Both, significantly, list as their earliest known ancestor as a Francis Harbison, born around 1831 in Ireland. i'm probably between 4 and 8 generations distant from Bruce, and I can probably identify his probable great-grandfather Francis. Odds are, therefore, I'm the same distance from Christopher T.
SNPs are usually in more conserved regions of the DNA, and define the haplotype. However, they're strongly correlated to STR numbers, so if you know enough STR numbers, you can figure out the haplotype indirectly. To do this directly is much more expensive. So from my 111 STR numbers, I'm told my haplotype is almost certainly I2a2a, although I'm going to have them do some SNPs to confirm and narrow it down. It turns out the I haplotype, while not common, is probably the earliest European haplotype. What I've seen online (and I can't vouch for it until I see the primary literature) suggests the I's were the original European Cro-Magnons, who were driven south-east to the Balkans by the great ice age, and then recolonized Europe, well before the Celts and the rest of that interloping trash. There are I2a2a's in old Russia, Scandinavia, Eastern Germany and the British Isles. Which particular clade of the I2a2a's remains to be determined.
Anyway, it's fun stuff, though not cheap, and if you're into it, I'd recommend you have it done. If nothing else, it's told me to search for the mysterious Francis, who was probably a first cousin 5 times removed, in passenger lists and US census data."

Weren't best of EU still higher than the best of NA though? Also: Before getting into the analysis, there are numerous caveats that must be considered. 1) While SQ generally increases with skill, it is possible that different playstyles may lead to higher or lower SQ scores. And it may be that different playstyles are more common in particular regions. For example, let's suppose two base all-ins result in a higher SQ score, and two base all-ins are more common on a particular server. The average SQ score may be inflated for that region, despite the players not being inherently any better at spending. I have not found any correlations between SQ and game duration in any of the leagues, but that does not entirely rule out this possibility. 2) In my previous analysis, I found that each race scored equally well in terms of SQ at all levels of the ladder. However, it is possible that at the absolute highest level, the races run into different ceilings on spending. This would introduce a bias against certain players, and may even slightly affect the average SQ for Grandmaster league between regions if there are different racial compositions. I don't yet have enough data to test this hypothesis. 3) If SQ is indeed balanced for all races, it is nonetheless possible that different match ups could differentially affect SQ. For example, Protoss could score the same as the other races on average, but score worse in PvP and better in PvT and PvZ. This is an analysis that I've not yet performed, so I don't know whether this is the case or not. 4) It's important to remember that many of the top players in each region are frequently in other regions (e.g., Korea). Furthermore, players often play on multiple regions. This means the top 10 for a particular region is not necessarily representative of the depth of the skill pool in each region. Caution needs to be exercised in analyzing the results - they should not be used to conclude that players from region A are better than players from region B. 5) It's been said before, but I'll say it again: SQ is not everything. The Spending Quotient does not take any strategic factors into account. It simply measures how well a player spends their money relative to all other players at the same level of income. When averaged across many games, it has been shown to correlate well with overall skill, and it measures one of the core skills. But it does not directly measure anything else. Maybe NA just drones less :P

I'd have to disagree with this. In my opinion, Reach removed much of the things that made Halo 3 so good. -Armor Lock was was a boring and frustrating mechanic. While I don't think it was imbalanced such as some people claimed, I thought it was bad game design. -The maps where not as good as in Halo 3, ranging from alright (Sword Base, Countdown, Powerhouse) to poor (Zealot, Hemorrhage, The Cage). -Movement was more sluggish (less movespeed, jump height, etc.). -Reach removed the skill-based 1-50 ranked matchmaking system from Halo 3 and replaced it with an experience-based system that simply measured total playtime, not skill. -The Jetpack, Active Camo, bloom and no shield bleedthrough for melee were, in my opinion, also poorly considered additions. +Forge World was a massive and ambitious improvement over the forge maps in Halo 3. +The addition of the DMR and buff to the Pistol shifted the focus more towards shield removal+headshots.

The technology keeps on advancing as we move ahead in time. It is as if it is in direct proportion to the time. Time goes forward and so does the technology, along with it. Several inventions and innovations have been taking place since the past decades. In the section of luminaires, quite a lot of products have been launched lately to make daily life much better and comfortable. Today, our necessity is the products that save electricity; the ones that consume low power. With more power, there is indeed a bigger electricity bill. Hence, as a step to help the public, Philips lighting has come up with energy saving bulbs and tube lights which even sustain themselves for quite a long time. Perhaps before they are completely utilized, a newer technology might arrive.  If you have a glance at the product catalogue, many new products can be observed under the section of luminaires. There are bulbs, tube lights, panel lights, LED lights and many such products included in this range. Better methods are approaching the markets in order to capture the businesses. Solar energy, tidal energy, wind energy and geothermal energy have been applied to produce electricity in large factories and industries. However in our daily household activities, we have to be dependent upon facilities from Philips Lighting that save our power and also cost us less in the long run. The products come with warranty based upon their price.  Framework of rice cooker Cooking starch has usually remained a technique which needed consideration to check whether the starch is cooked properly. Electronic appliances thus automate the course by instinctively or electronically controlling heat and timing, thus freeing up a heating element on the cooking range that had to be otherwise occupied for starch cooking. Although the instrument does not essentially speed up the cooking process, with an electric instrument the cook&#8217;s involvement in cooking starch is reduced to simply measuring the same, preparing it properly and using the correct amount of water. Once the rice cooker is set to cook, it will be cooked with no further attention.  Different material rice cooker These commodities are separated into variations like culinary pots and cooking pans, steamers, ceramic or plastic containers for microwave ovens and gas and electrical usages. But majorly in the households, electrical types are found. In viable or business use, there are plenty of ranges in the same. They are mostly large gas or electric which lever the entire cooking process from washing to the end of the cycle.  Dedicated rice cooker dates long ago in the human history. In fact, a ceramic steamer has been recorded to be present during 1250 BC and is on the display at the British Museum.  Features of a rice cooker For the modern home appliances, the smallest single-person model boils 1 cup (180 ml), although large models can boil 10 cups. Commercial models can boil 20 or more cups. As a possible source of confusion, model specifications and names may list either boiled or unprepared capacity. Starch roughly doubles in size during cooking; therefore, a 10 cup rice cooker can produce up to 20 cups of cooked starch. These features help to determine the quantity depending upon the number of family members.

Thursday, September 3, 2015 5 UHeart Organizing: Heart Eyes for this High/Low Dresser I always love a good high/low challenge. In fact, some of my favorite pages in HGTV's magazine are the High/Low picks. Whenever I am sourcing items for our home, my first step is to think big and seek out exactly what I want without even looking at price tags. Once I have my heart set on something, then I start playing the budget game. What is the cost of the original? Can I find something similar in style for less? Can I modify an item to achieve a comparable look? Can we build something from scratch, and if so, what is the cost of materials and our time? So many questions, but typically those questions save us money in the long run and allow us to keep a good balance of high and low pieces throughout our home. Megan blogs over at Honey We're Home and she has also become a very dear friend of mine. She recently found out she is expecting her second child, and I couldn't be more excited for their growing (and glowing) family. When they found out the news, it created a ripple effect of exciting changes to their home. I am honored to have her here today to share a fabulous dresser combination that will hopefully inspire all of you to play the high/low game as well. Hello IHeart friends! It's good to be back and it's an especially exciting time for our family as we are currently expecting baby #2 ! These new family changes have prompted some changes in our home as well. Our 5-year old son, James, recently moved from his former colorful room into the guest room and we've been working on transforming it into a room fit for a fast growing little boy! The dresser that was previously in the room was mine from collage and had definitely seen better days, so we decided to upgrade. I wanted a wooden piece that would add some rustic charm to the room. I found a great style for a boy's room at Restoration Hardware, but I didn't want to spend that much money. Restoration Hardware Printmaker's 6-Drawer Dresser $1795 I kept searching and found something similar at Overstock (the Melrose Pine Dresser ) that I felt could be made to look like the RH version if I added bronzed cup pulls. And it was $1200 less! The Overstock version is slightly smaller (2 inches shorter and 7 inches less wide), but that worked better for our space anyway. The pulls at my local hardware store were twice as expensive as the ones I found online at Amazon, so I went with the Amazon version . They look fantastic and are good quality, however, the screws that came with the pulls were too short (1 inch) for our dresser, so we had to buy a pack of 1 3/4 inch wood screws to fit the drawers properly. A 50 pack was only $5. I had to enlist my hubby to help make sure I got the measurements exactly right so the pulls would line up straight. He's so good at stuff like this but hates doing it, so I owe him! He made a template that we used on each drawer to mark where the drill holes needed to be. Then got to drilling! It didn't take long to drill all the holes and we only had trouble with one area where the wood was naturally distressed, but it ended up being fine. (You can see that spot in the second picture below). In the end, when we went to screw in the pulls, a few drill holes needed to be expanded just a hair. And then a quick vacuum of all the wood dust before putting in the drawer liners and clothes. I think it came out great and looks very similar to the RH version (for about $1200 less)! Above the dresser I added the mirror I spray painted red and the red lamps I found on Joss & Main (yes, James "decorated" one with Paw Patrol stickers). Last summer, when I first saw the stickers on the lamp I found him downstairs in the kitchen and asked, "Who put the stickers on your lamp?" Without batting an eye he replied, "An invisible man. You'll never see him." Still cracks me up when I think about it. Inside the drawers I added red and white fabric drawer liners. To make the liners, I simply measured the drawers and cut to the appropriate size. Then, I saturated the fabric in liquid starch to make the fabric stiff. Once the fabric dries, it will become harder like flexible poster board. Then you just iron them to get the wrinkles out. And to keep the shorts and pants nice and organized, I learned a trick to fold and lay them on their sides so you can see each item at a glance. I like this so much better than my old way of stacking the shorts and pants. Now, I can quickly find exactly what I'm looking for and the previously bottom layers don't get as wrinkled from being weighed down. I still keep the shirts laying flat since they are pretty flimsy and don't stack as well as the pants do. We are so overjoyed and excited to be welcoming a new addition to our family! In the meantime, we still have a lot of home projects to keep us busy and James' new room is on it's way to being complete. I must be already in nesting mode because I've been on a major cleaning and organizing kick lately. I recently redid our linen closet (it's so lovely now!) and found a great solution for organizing all my purses and tote bags . Only 6 months to go!

"Featured on Forbes.com
Recently, the annual list of companies with the worst customer service came out and it got me thinking. It's time that marketers seized the opportunity of ""helpfulness"" and use its value at every stage of the purchase journey, from prospect to long-term, raving fan. All too often, helpfulness is dismissed as a throwaway, when it can be transformed into your most valuable engagement strategy.
According to Forrester, good customer service is all about being anticipatory, helpful and responsive using predictive analytics and cognitive engagement.
Customers want effortless interactions over web and mobile self-service channels as well as via new channels such as video chat.
Proactive engagement for pre-purchase consumers answers the questions that drive the pre-purchase journey. Learnings can then be used improve operational performance and to predict future customer behavior.
Post-purchase satisfaction is dependent upon preemptive service that offers faster resolution at lower costs, with deeply personalized engagement, better planning and anticipation of future customer needs.
Similac Offers Help Now For Goodwill On Purchases Later
It may seem counterintuitive to offer breastfeeding help when you are a baby-formula company, but Similac knows that information means goodwill. And goodwill breeds legions of devoted customers.
The company offers a wide array of online help as well as communities on its website that range from ""My Pregnancy"" to ""My Baby"" to ""Feeding Expert."" This demonstrates that the company is offering help quite literally at every stage of a new mom's and new baby's lifecycle.
The company took on the controversy of breastfeeding in a TV commercial campaign called ""The Sisterhood of Motherhood."" ""We make formula, and parents who use our products are often judged for how they parent and the decisions that they make,"" said Misha Pardubicka-Jenkins, director of Pediatric Nutrition at Abbott. ""So we're putting a stake in the ground and we want everybody to support one another in the spirit of acceptance. All moms want to feel empowered in the decisions they make and feel supported by everyone.""
The feedback since the video went up has been ""very positive,"" with more than eight million views onYouTube. Additionally, Similac ranks in top spots on the 2015 list of leading baby formula brands in the U.S.
IBM Gives Business What It Needs To Succeed
In a b-to-b environment, IBM has taken not only the necessary steps to understand the industries it supports with products and services that help businesses perform at a higher level, but they have also gone one step beyond to offer helpful research and studies on topics that are important to those industries.
Regarding the use of Instagram for b-to-b engagement, Katie Keating, social content & engagement strategist at IBM, commented, ""We prioritized engagement over number of followers. This put the IBM account way ahead of larger b-to-b companies [that] are well-known for their social media prowess... [We] curate content that is intriguing to our audiences, that maybe teaches them something simple but useful, and builds trust among our followers.... We don't want to speak into a void but to an engaged, interested audience, so listening and gathering feedback is a critical first step before we publish anything... give access and meaning to your brand. Don't try to promote, sell, drive clicks ... You will drive engagement and preference for your brand by being real and staying true to the platform.""
IBM is one of the top Instagram accounts named as No. 1 by the simply measured ""Retail Brand Social Media Report,"" with 9,265 followers and an engagement rate of 4.04%, (versus the average engagement rate for the top retail brands of 4%).
TakeAways:
Marketers need to stop thinking of support as a list of stale FAQs. Being truly supportive means being relevant and helpful at every step, addressing everything from pre-purchase questions to post-purchase issue resolution. Develop value-based content and resources outside of sales-driven messaging that demonstrates authentic understanding and concern for your customers.
Create resource centers that are accessible on multiple media, address the needs of a variety of consumers and where they are in their life stages, careers and their dealings with your company. Marketers need to position themselves as invaluable resources for ""helpfulness"" to customers throughout every step of the purchase and post purchase journey. Now is the time revisit support strategies to transform them into powerful engagement vehicles.

RT @getblogphotos: #SimplyMeasured: The 5 Keys to Social Media Measurement For Every Network: http://t.co/LVcEmN2SWs  http://t.co/B0rahd7KCl #socialmedia
"Since the emergence of the Internet, two major trends have changed the content and marketing landscape, with marketers in SMEs and brands having to react as these trends have played out.
The first is that companies had to become increasingly like publishers, as search engines such as Google and Bing rewarded them for producing engaging content with better positions in their rankings. The nature of the Internet and network effect also made this content a powerful marketing tool when widely shared. The key was producing engaging content, attracting links and social engagements – producing poor content didn’t cut it.
As such SMEs and brands began to produce a rich array of content including blogs, podcasts, videos, etc.; becoming impressive publishers as they did. Our rankings of the biggest brands on social media tips a cap to the most successful brand publishers and shows how effectively they’ve responded.
The rise of content marketing analytics The other trend, and another market reaction, was a growing range of analytics tools being developed to empower marketers with improved understanding of fertile content themes to exploit, content types to produce and performance of content in their sector – their brand’s and their competitors’.
These analytics tools helped marketers see what content types had collected links from external web properties, how many links had been earned and what sort of sites had been responsible for the link profiles of brands. Other tools showed what velocity of link building brands had been achieving and a range of other data points which helped marketers calculate the levels of content marketing competition in a sector and what investment and resources might need to be deployed to compete.
I remember years of digging into the link profiles of brands, using tools such as Moz’s Open Site Explorer , Majestic and SEO Profiler , as I too lived within this trend, spending countless hours of time staring at data exports in Excel files to understand content marketing trends.
The emergence of social media in these trends Then, in the post social media world, new analytics tool appeared, measuring social signals collected on this SME and brand content, revealing statistics such as how many social engagements were being achieved across these content portfolios, from which social platforms and at what velocity. These social analytics tools have further empowered marketers with new layers of data to better plan, strategically and tactically.
I personally benefited from the use of tools such as FollowerWonk , Simply Measured and Quintly , as myself and other marketing friends also reacted to the rise of major social platforms and their implications for planning and measuring content marketing.
In 2015, with these trends now forcefully affecting content and marketing more generally, marketers are producing record levels of content, whilst using a range of tools to measure their content marketing performance. Roles such as Chief Content Officer now exist in Fortune 500 firms and brands such as Warby Parker even invest in their annual reports , turning them into impressive content pieces. Tech firms Google and Facebook have also played pre-eminent roles in driving these trends.
Now everyone has a content marketing tool kit With the impact of these trends now deeply felt, new challenges have emerged for marketers. In the early days of content marketing, early adopters enjoyed large benefits from using new powerful analytics tools. But, as the years rolled by these tools became widely adopted as all marketers strove to keep up-to-date.
It was like a content marketing arms race and once someone had a new analytics app and performance advantage, similar to an atomic bomb in an actual arms race, everyone else had to have one. Everyone now has a content marketing tool kit, composed of a range of smart technologies and apps.
As a result, forward thinking marketers are always looking at the next development in marketing analytics, to see what direction new innovation will head and what it means for their SME or brand’s marketing strategies. Being the first to adopt and successfully leverage new tech is key and CMOs have increasingly become masters of many technologies , as their role has become ever more complex and technical.
So, what new important innovations and tools are shaping marketing today?
Real-time content marketing is no longer a pipe dream I think, after years of new tools helping marketers look in the rear view mirror – seeing what content has worked, when, where and why – future innovation in content marketing is going to become all about real-time.
The improving strategic view marketers were achieving with previous new tools was very much a historical one, illuminating marketing tactics and success in their sector, over the long term and medium term. Even if a short-term view was possible, it certainly wasn’t real-time. A good example of this is Majestic, a tool I know well and love, but which by crawling backlinks twice a day, perhaps isn’t real-time enough to show marketers what linking trends are happening right now. (This is no slight on Majestic and no doubt the challenges involved in real-time crawling of link profiles in the Web are enormous, even for Google.)
Few tools had been developed that allowed content marketing to be truly agile, responding to instant shifts in markets and the changing interest in SME and brands’ audiences. However, this is set to change.
The power of NewsWhip Spike for marketers and content gurus New tools such as Spike from NewsWhip – a dashboard showing brands what’s trending with their audience in real-time via Social Velocity metrics – are being developed to further empower marketers.
Our Spike dashboard has become heavily used by publishers around the world, helping them identify news stories taking off and changes in audience interest, to then agilely respond with content to match these short-term trends. We’re proud that our technology drives meaningful results too, with numbers of our clients doubling their readership and reach after using Spike as their key discovery tools.
Short-term interest trends around RedBull content
And now, remembering once more that brands are becoming ever more like publishers, we’re seeing marketers start to understand the power of Spike, as a new tool in their content marketing toolkit.
Major brands, in markets as diverse as banking, credit and various types of technology, are now using Spike to add a real-time edge to their content marketing and their communications too. If you’re a major brand trying to increase your awareness and brand equity within a specific demographic, being able to react to content trends interesting this demographic, in real-time, is a powerful new ability.
Brands acting like publishers, again We’re seeing our brand clients using Spike more and more similarly to the likes of BBC, Guardian and Huffington Post, supplementing the strategic benefits of their view in the rear view mirror with real-time social signals that can guide content strategy and how they talk to their audiences online today.
Trending signals, mostly gathered from social media, have important implications for many sectors. Marketing is no exception to this rule.
Short-term interest trends around Nike product
These signals show what is really engaging an audience now, what matters this minute to target demographics and how powerful this interest trend is. Our Social Velocity scores are thus powerful bottom-up signals, for marketers as well as publishers and newsrooms. We believe that the crowd isn’t dumb, it knows what it likes and these social signals have profound implications for marketers.
We noted the content hit that Ben and Jerry’s achieved in June – with its ‘I dough, I dough campaign’ smartly and tastefully working the marriage equality debate – but, could such a brand improve the reach of its content and message even further by monitoring and reacting to short-term social interest trends within this larger issue? We think so.
How the marketing industry responds to these social trending signals, and the apps supplying them, will be fascinating to behold. One thing is becoming increasing clear though – the future of content marketing is real-time.

"Simply Measured Acquires DataRank to Become Most Complete Social Analytics Software 2015-10-13T06:00:37+00:00 Adam Schoenfeld
Social marketing has evolved. What was once an experiment that kept the intern busy is now a serious marketing function.
Brands have made significant investments in social, but few would say that they are truly “data-driven” today. Access to the right data and insight is the key to enabling better marketing, but the current tools have failed to keep up with a rapidly changing market. Our long-term goal at Simply Measured is to solve this problem.
Today, I’m excited to announce that we’ve taken a huge step in that mission by acquiring DataRank , a social intelligence solution that helps marketers derive insights from social data and online conversations.
Like you, we see social data as an opportunity for better research. We have evaluated countless “social listening” tools, and DataRank is the first tool we’ve seen that goes beyond passive “listening” and delivers real social intelligence and research from online conversations.
Combining this unique social intelligence with our analytics platform takes you a step closer to truly data-driven marketing. Social Analytics for Data-Driven Marketing
Data-driven marketing requires tools which combine advanced measurement with research, and connect the dots for better execution.
Adding DataRank’s social intelligence product to Simply Measured immediately supercharges our research capabilities. In August, we acquired Seattle-based Inside Social, a company focused on attribution and social ROI that significantly enhances our measurement capabilities.
In the data-drive marketing process, there are three stages: Research, Execute, and Measure.
Our mission at Simply Measured is to enable marketers to do their best work possible by prioritizing research and measurement. These two acquisitions are important because they help us enable marketers in each category. In a world where data is becoming more and more abundant, marketers need access to the right data, not just more data.
Most social technology suites focus on helping marketers publish, manage workflows, and execute campaigns, with analytics as an afterthought.
Workflow problems are solved, but data and insights give marketers the competitive advantage. Dedicated to Data: A Shared Vision
DataRank and Simply Measured are dedicated to helping brands put analytics first in their social marketing programs. By coupling the two services, we’re able to give marketers access to the right data and insights to research new opportunities, measure performance, and optimize results.
According to ‘ The Right Way To Measure Social Marketing ,’ a September 2015 report from Forrester Research, 53 percent of social relationship marketers surveyed listed measurement as among their top problem area when running branded social accounts, far beyond any other issue.
Our goal at Simply Measured is to put practical data in your hands and enable you to do your best work, simply. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured analytics platform, we’re able to take that mission to another level. Want to Learn More?

Advertisement Back during the hype for Ocarina of Time when Shiggy announced that it would take more than 24h to cross Hyrule my mind was blown and how big was the disappointment when I realized he was talking about ingame time, which wasn’t that long at all (except maybe you stay in Hyrule Castle Town for a year or something). This was actually one of the reasons I didn’t like Ocarina much (jup, actually I think it’s the worst of the one’s I’ve played: LoZ, LA, ALLTP, OoT, OoA, OaS, MC, WW, TP) and don’t even get me started on the timeline stuff, which I think is not existing at all. I guess the reason so many people think Ocarina is the best is because it was their first Zelda. Well, mine was ALLTP and such I already found Ocarina way to easy and knew almost immediately the answers. Also Ocarina was sterile in my opinion lacking an atmosphere that was existing before and was only restored since Wind Waker (probably because the GameCube was so much more powerful than the N64). TP is actually my favourite Zelda game and the reason is it brought back the scope of Hyrule I once imagined in my head, when I was smaller. Of course the 2D Hyrules are in retrospect not that large at all and I asked myself which Hyrule was largest. Unfortunately I didn’t find much on the internet, except for those comparisons of the different Hyrules trying to force the maps on each other, which as said I think a waste of time. Thus I tried to find some way to compare the maps myself, of course this is all rather vague and a lot of guesswork, but I thought I’d share, maybe it’s of some use for someone of you. If you have more accurate ways of measuring Hyrule feel free to comment. Since I’m European I am using the metric system, I am sure you guys know how to use the internet for conversion methods. Beside other methods I as a measure that I can walk about 100m per minute when trying to walk fast on a plane but not running. Legend of Zelda: http://yourseosucks.com/pictures/the-legend-of-zelda-hyrule-map.jpg The problem here is the deformed portrayal of the world. Comparing people, items, landmarks I assumed 1 tile ingame corresponds roughly to a squaremetre. Thus one screen is about 16x11 m^2. This of course seems to be a little small for some, but just ok for others, so I stick with it. Hyrule consists of 16x8 screens therefore its size corresponds to roughly 256x88 m^2 (~about 5 football fields beside each other), which kinda fits to the walking times. Adventure of Link: http://faqsmedia.ign.com/faqs/image/reyvgm_zelda2.gif The problem here, is that it really is more a map roughly with landmarks, than a detailed portrayal of the environment. But since the Hyrule from LoZ is part of the map I had a was to compare. I assumed 1 tile to correspond roughly to one screen, which is too much in some cases (graveyard) and too little in others (Lake). The AoL map consists of 169x118 tiles, if one tile is 16x11m^2 all of Hyrule would be 2704x1298 m^2. Still about 50% of the map is ocean, so this might have to be subtracted. A Link to the Past: http://www.drankpee.com/drankblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/map-zelda-3.jpg Here again the deformation style problem arises, and again I figured that one tile corresponds to 1 squaremetre. The ATTLP map consists of 256x256 tiles and such 256x256 m^2. Comparing with my walking this is already way overestimated. Walking from the southereast corner of Lake Hylia the the westerneast corner of the desert took me about 60 sec of walking including walking around corners at some points. Here I realized that the Hyrule of ALLTP really is not that big as I remembered it be. The Ocarina of Time: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/mat4404/RealHyruleMap.jpg For the 3D iterations it should actually be possible to accurately get the sizes by simply measuring the 3D models, but as I don’t have any access to them, not even to the game right now I did a lot of guessing. From a picture of adult link on the bridge of Lake Hylia I figured that the width of that bridge is about twice the height of Link which I set to 1,80m (6 feet for you nonmetric people). The bridge is visible on the onscreen-map, but since these maps vary in scaling I used the following map as a reference. The width of the bridge here is about 4px, the whole picture of 800x800 pixels would thus correspond to 720x720 m^2. Still the picture is way larger than Hyrule so I counted pixels and came to the conclusion, that Hyrule of OoT only covers a little above one sixth of that map. WindWaker: http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/17012/images/worldmap_590_hearts.jpg Here we also have some kind of deformation problems and since I don’t own the game, it’s a very long time ago I played it and didn’t find a high resolution map this was the hardest to guess. From some youtube video I guessed, that one side of one of the triangle islands might be about 15 metres long. On this map here which seemed to be the most accurate I could find this corresponds to about 5px. The whole map is 590x590px and such1770x1770m^2. Very roughly one coordinate square is 250x250 m^2. Still I didn’t quite believe this, since I remembered Outset to be larger, I have to check that, when I get access to that game if my assumptions are reasonable. Using again the powers of pixel counting and some very rough overestimations (especially where the Heatpiece symbols cover the islands) I concluded, that only 2,5% of the map are actual land masses. Twilight princess: http://zeldapower.com/images/tp/maps/item_map.jpg Here I used the bridge of Eldin as reference. Its width is roughly 6 times the height of Link (again assumed to be 1,80m) thus about 10,8m. The Twilight Princess map seemed to be a very detailed at up to scale representation of Hyrule therefore I assumed the 10px from that picture as the width of the bridge to correspond to 10,8m. The whole map 1536x1968px is thus 1659 x 2125 m^2, but again only about 27% of the graphic are Hyrule area. Measuring the scale on the bottom of the map leads me to the assumption that it is about 500m long. I then let link walk quickly along the bridge, which took me about 80 sec walking (32 sec running) corresponding to about 133 metres. I measured 110 px = 119 metres. So I think I am not too far off here. I also measured some other distances and got similar results. To conclude a side by side comparison of effective Hyrule areas (without oceans or empty map regions): LoZ: 0,0225 km^2 AoL: 1,766 km^2 ALttP: 0,0656 km^2 OoT: 0,09866 km^2 WindWaker: 0,0835 km^2 TP: 0,9555 km^2 I know that these estimates are way too rough but it is still nice to know how they roughly compare, especially the 3D versions. I thought it’s interesting, that Ocarina is effectively larger that Wind Waker when getting rid of the ocean and that TP is roughly 10x larger than Ocarina, which I found awesome.

Some notes on golf ball compression from this web page: http://www.golfball-guide.de/knowledge.htm Some balls are indicated with a compression of 80, 90 or 100 etc. Originally it was used as a measurement for quality of 3-piece balls, where a long rubber was streched arround the core. The rubber had a lenght of approx. 20 meters and was streched at a factor of approx. 20 times of its original, depending on the compression that is wanted. This way it is wounded arround the core. It was said that the tighter the windings, the better the ball performed. This created a long-standing perception that compression affects golf ball distance and performance. Because golf ball technology uses newer heat-resistant threads with newer and better winding equipment for three piece balls, golf ball compression has become merely a condition of feel. Now with the availability of the consistent quality of a two piece ball, compression as a measurement of quality is rather obsolete. Definition: Today the word "compression" in the golf ball industry relates to a value expressed by a number in the range from 0 to 200 that is given a golf ball. This number defines the deflection that a golf ball undergoes when subjected to a compressive load. Compression simply measures how much the shape a golf ball changes under a constant weight. Measurement: All three-piece balls and some two-piece balls are measured for compression. A ball that doesn't compress is rated 200; a ball that deflects 2/10ths of an inch or more is rated zero. Between those two extremes, for every 1/1000ths of an inch that the ball compresses, it drops one point from 200 and the compression rating is then established. Most balls have compression ratings of either 80, 90, or 100; the lower the compression, the softer the feel. Not every ball marked 80, 90, or 100 is exactly that rating. The actual rating can fall roughly within 3-5 points on either side of the indication. Any ball that falls out of this range is usually sold as range ball, or as X-outs. Prove: There have been several published texts to prove that golf ball compression relates more to feel and your own superstition than its performance. The conclusions were, if you take different rated golf balls which have the same construction, aerodynamics, and cover material, and use an automatic golf swing machine such as the Iron Man, the yardage difference between the balls hit were negligible, less than two yards.

Some people have asked me how I can possibly still be losing weight when I am caught consuming a Baconator and fries. While I was indulging there, the trick is the fact that the only other thing I ate that day was a single banana. I wouldn't recommend the Baconator diet, but weight loss can still be achieved even with indulgent meals. You'll just go hungry the rest of the day. I use My Fitness Pal to track my calorie intake. Weight loss is literally just calories burned vs calories consumed. As long as calories burned > calories consumed, there will be weight loss. Today I had a banana for breakfast, 300 calories worth of broccoli salad for lunch, and I found to meet my calorie goals, I still needed nearly 1000 calories the rest of the day. I took it as an opportunity and made my take on a breakfast crunch wrap, with sausage, egg, hash browns, hot sauce, avocado, sour cream, and cheese all wrapped up in a tortilla and griddled shut. It was amazing, and it was exactly the kind of thing I would have made myself in the past all the freaking time. It's why I ballooned up to nearly 250 pounds. I simply measured each ingredient and carefully added the calorie content of each to ensure I did not go over my limit. It was delicious. I'm almost at 200 pounds now, with over 40 pounds lost. Calories in, calories out, just try to have a somewhat balanced diet to ensure proper nutrition. Doesn't mean you have to suffer.

You can simply measure the hosel depth and then the shim and trim as needed. You just want the shim to be slightly lower in the hosel so it allows the ferrule to set tight. It is always best to get the correct size shafts, but shims will do the job if needed. I always have liked the shims to be epoxied to the shaft ahead of time. I normally do this a day ahead of time and then install the shafts. Best also to dry fit every iron. Hosel depth should be the same, but I always want to be 100% sure.

My husband is from Thailand so we eat a lot of rice..and who wants to sit around hovering over a hot stove waiting for it to cook ? Not this white girl! So we got this rice cooker! OK we got it mostly because my husband polietly stated that I apparently stink at making rice, and I don't make it like his mother...well I am German we don't cook much rice!! This cooker is great! All you do after you wash your rice off (you know you were supposed to do that right?) so you just simply measure out the amount of rice you will need and the water that is indicated on the interior rim of the cooker and simply pour both in and viola! You are done until the cooker beeps you ! Very convenient! This also helps out while you are busy cooking the other part of your meal. The rice cooker also opens up another burner on your stove for you to use. It easily stores away and doesn't take up much room at all in the cupboard area.

You will be able to keep your home in better condition if you allot a reasonable amount for home repairs. If you find you have money left over from what you planned to spend on your home, use that money for bigger, more ambitious projects the next year.Individual solar lights can be obtained cheaply, and come in a number of different styles, but they won't do much apart from look pretty. If you need effective outdoor lighting, electric is the way to go. These may cost more but they work better.If the front of your home is a bit drab and boring, a pergola can spice it right up.

This is a simple gateway to the Exi-Chat mailinglist, a discussion group for Transhumanist topics. Its been setup for those who'd prefer to follow the discussions with an RSS reader. Sunday, August 23, 2015 Re: [ExI] Old Nutrition Studies Harvey Newstrom Much appreciated. bill w On Sun, Aug 23, 2015 at 10:44 AM, Harvey Newstrom < mail@harveynewstrom.com > wrote: The China study is old. It started in 1983 and measured variables of diet known at the time. We know a lot more now. Nobody should be taking their advice from such an old study. The question of whether this study was "right" or "wrong" is irrelevant. We know a lot more nuance about nutrition now than we did then. So arguing whether this study was right or wrong misses the point about whether we should eat meat, fat, cholesterol, or turn vegetarian. Here are some examples of what has changed since the China study and other similar older studies. 1. Early statistics seemed to show that meat causes cancer. People who ate meat get cancer at statistically higher rates than people who didn't eat meat. So it made sense to avoid meat. However, correlation does not mean causation. Later studies subdivided variables to try to isolate how and why meat causes cancer. It turns out that cooking method was one of the big factors in this. Charring meat with heat creates carcinogens. If we cook meat without charring it, we avoid the creation of most of these carcinogens. Does that mean the original studies were wrong and meat did not cause cancer? I say no. As a whole, most meat really was causing cancer. But does this mean that the study was right and should we stop eating meat to avoid cancer? Again, no. We now know how to cook meat to avoid these charring induced carcinogens. Does that mean reality changed or the studies keep flip-flopping? No, we learn more and more and keep further refining our nutritional understanding. This is not the same as being wrong or changing our theories all the time. We are actually continually improving our theories so that they get better and better over time. 2. Early statistics seemed to show that cholesterol clogs arteries leading to heart attacks. People who had higher blood cholesterol levels get clogged arteries and have heart attacks at statistically higher rates than people who don't. So it made sense to avoid dietary cholesterol. However, correlation does not mean causation. Later studies subdivided variables even further. It turns out that dietary cholesterol is very small and does not raise blood cholesterol as much as other dietary factors that raise cholesterol. Eating cholesterol containing foods such as eggs and shellfish turns out to not raise blood cholesterol very much. However, eating lots of saturated fats and refined carbohydrates turns out to skyrocket cholesterol and related compounds like triglycerides. We also know that there are different kinds of cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol and other kinds of cholesterol. Most people have the bad kind, so most early studies found the bad results. But some people who measured "high cholesterol" actually had low bad cholesterol and high good cholesterol. Such people actually had better results they higher their good cholesterol got. So any old study (such as the China study) that simply measures "cholesterol" without distinguishing the good from the bad is practically useless. We don't know what they were measuring. We don't know if differences were in the good or bad kind. We don't correlate which changes caused which results. Does that mean the original studies were wrong and cholesterol did not cause heart attacks? I say no. As a whole, most high cholesterol readings were the bad cholesterol which really was causing heart attacks. But does this mean that the study was right and should we stop eating cholesterol or use blood cholesterol levels to predict heart attacks? Again, no. We now know that total cholesterol does not indicate good or bad predictions. We now look at different cholesterol levels and the ratios between them for better measures. Again, we are not changing the theories about cholesterol. We are further refining our nutritional understanding of how different cholesterols effect the cardiovascular system. 3. There are similar examples with eating a high fat diet. We now know that there are good fats and bad fats. Early studies did not distinguish between good fats and bad fats. We now know that some fats should be decreased in the diet while others should be increased. It is too simplistic to argue whether "fat" is good or bad. 4. A related example of refining our knowledge occurred with butter vs. margarine. Scientists were correct when they statistically correlated saturated fat with heart attacks. They suggested that people switch from butter to vegetable oils. So many people did. And many people started having more problems than before. Were the scientists wrong? Not really. We now know that most vegetable oil margarines are hydrogenated, making them even more super-saturated than the saturated fats. They also induced more trans fats, which is also a very bad dietary fat. So while scientists recommended that people switch to vegetable oils to eat less saturated far, people actually switched to hydrogenated vegetable oils which were even more saturated fat than before. While it was mistakenly believed that people were eating less saturated fat, they were actually eating much more saturated fat. We now know a lot more about the whole spectrum of fats. And we know that hydrogenated oil! s in margarines are worse than saturated fats in the same way that saturated fats are worse than natural vegetable oils. 5. There are older studies that found that the autopsied brains of people who ate soy had more dementia indications than people who did not eat soy. However it was later found that the people who ate soy were living longer. So what they really found was that older people have more dementia indications than younger people. When correlated for age, people who eat soy do not have more dementia indications than people who do not eat soy. 6. There was a recent theory that too much estrogen might cause hormone problems for males and that soy contains a pseudo-estrogen. So people stopped drinking soy milk and switched back to cow's milk. Then it was realized that cow's milk has a magnitude more times real estrogen than soy has pseudo estrogens. If people really wanted to avoid estrogen, they should stop drinking cow's milk and switch to soy milk. My point with these various examples is that science works over time and keeps getting better and better. But it's not perfect. We cannot argue whether an older study is right or wrong. The answer is almost always more nuanced and has to be subdivided into other better questions about what was right and what was wrong. Ideas about increasing or decreasing a single food group (meat, grains, dairy) or a single macronutrient (fat, protein, carbs) are usually too simplistic. The more we study these questions, the more they fragment into many more precise questions until the original question becomes meaningless. Are carbs good or bad? Is fat good or bad? Is meat good or bad? Is vegetarianism better or worse? Is veganism better or worse? All of these are invalid questions. Depending what kinds of carbs, fats, meats, vegetarian diet or vegan diet you choose, you can answer these questions either way. And the answer to the question about whether any particular study is good or bad should be approach by looking at further refined studies. It almost never can be answered by deciding if the study is good (and accepting all of its conclusions) or deciding that a study is bad (and rejecting all of its conclusions). Both of these extreme edge-case positions is almost always wrong. --

"Chain maintenance for a smooth ride by Kristen Legan Submit
Chain maintenance isn’t the sexiest of topics when it comes to cycling and the glitz of new bikes and shiny components. The drivetrain probably isn’t the first place you look when checking out a new bike, but the chain and associated parts are some of the most important components for a great cycling experience.
If you hear constant squeaking while pedaling your bike or your chain skips around when you shift to another gear, a dirty drivetrain could be to blame. By regularly cleaning and lubricating your chain, your bike’s shifting will feel crisper, your pedal strokes will feel smoother and you”ll get more life out of your components.
So get your hands dirty (actually, let’s keep them clean by wearing gloves), and use these quick and easy tips for cleaning your chain and drivetrain. General chain care
Wipe your chain. Use a rag or an old t-shirt to wipe down your chain after every few rides. Grab the bottom of the chain with the rag and rotate the crank backwards for several revolutions. Letting the chain run snugly through the rag.
Lube your chain. Apply a small amount of lube after wiping down your chain. Apply lube to the “inside” surface of the chain, which the part that makes contact with the cogs and chainrings. One drop on each link is plenty.
Choose the right lube. Pick a lube that suits your normal riding conditions. Wet lube is stickier and great for wet weather riding because it won’t wash off easily in the rain. Dry lubes are not as sticky so they don’t pick up as much dirt and is intended from dry and dusty riding conditions. Washing the Drivetrain
How often you need to wash your drivetrain depends on how much your ride, what conditions your ride in, and how often you wipe down and lube your chain. The more preventative maintenance you do, the less often you’ll need to wash your chain. But I’d suggest washing it every few weeks if you’re a regular rider or you frequently ride in wet or muddy conditions.
Wear gloves. Protect your hands from degreasers and chemicals used to wash your bike. Even environmentally friendly, citrus-based degreasers will strip oils from your hands. Disposable latex or nitrile gloves work great for this but reusable, heavy-duty gloves will also work just fine.
Degrease the drivetrain. Use a citrus-based degreaser to remove road grime and grease build-up on the chain. A couple paintbrushes or even an old toothbrush work well for scrubbing the chain, chainrings, cogs and derailleur pulleys. Make sure you get the front and back of each of these until the dark grease build-up is gone.
Rinse and Repeat. Spray the entire drivetrain with clean water as you spin the crank to ensure everything is rinsed clean. If your bike was extremely dirty, you may need to repeat the washing process to fully remove tough, stuck on gunk. Pro Tip
I love the Park Tool Chain Scrubber for degreasing drivetrains. Just pour degreaser into the scrubber’s reservoir, hook it onto your bike’s chain, and turn the crank so the chain runs through the tool. Internal brushes scrub the chain clean without the hassle or mess of doing it by hand. Don’t forget to scrub the chainrings, cogs, and pulleys by hand though! Replace parts when necessary
Replacing worn out parts of your drivetrain will keep your bike running smoothly. Again, the regularity of replacing parts depends on your riding conditions and volume. Here are some easy checks you can do on a regular basis to determine if something needs replacing.
Check your chain. Over time, the links in your bike’s chain stretch apart from each other and can cause poor shifting and excessive wear and tear on your cogs and chainrings. Use a chain checker tool to determine if your bike’s chain needs to be replaced. Most chain checker tools simply measure the length between several cogs of your chain to determine how much the chain has stretched. They’re easy to use and worth keeping around with your other tools.
Check your chainrings and cogs. If your bike’s chainrings and cogs have teeth that are worn down and look hooked, it’s time to replace them. Put on a new chain when you replace your cogset and chainrings. An old chain on new drivetrain parts will speed up the degradation process of these more expensive pieces. Replacing a chain is substantially less expensive than continually replacing cogs and chainrings.
Keeping up with bike maintenance is the best way to avoid more serious problems down the road. However, if you are unsure about any mechanical issues or maintenance procedures, take your bike into your local bike shop for expert help.

Great article! Definitely saving this for the next time someone asks me about basic maintenance… Adding on: Degreasing: If degreaser is used, make sure as much of the degreaser is off the chain as possible before oiling it again otherwise 40 km in to a ride you’ll have one squeaky, squeaky drivetrain.
Cleaning the cogs: If you’re going the toothbrush route, an old credit card or membership card will take off the hard gunked up stuff on the pulley wheels faster and easier than a toothbrush can. Use the credit card to remove the hard stuff, run an old shirt between the cassette teeth to get most of the grime out, then finish it off with the soft brushes. The gunk will likely go everywhere so try to avoid stepping in it, that stuff never comes out of the carpet.
Checking the chain: Park Tools used to sell an older model CC-3 and now sell a better CC-3.2 that looks the same but has a tighter tolerance. I’ve frequently tested chains using the CC-3 as “ok” but the mechanic correctly states they’re in need of replacement. The newer models are worth the extra cash, especially if you ride on a 11sp chain. CYCLINGTIPS"

"Quote: : The things to measure are voltage at the driver's terminals and the current between each driver and do it at different frequencies around the resonant frequency of the driver's, right? Am I missing something to measure to record for this test? Shredhead,
Yes, simply measure the frequency response and output level using band limited pink noise just under amplifier clipping or current limiting to see which wiring scheme works best for your particular speaker loads. Try it again with the type of music you intend to play, especially if it is music of very low dynamic range that will put a heavy duty cycle on the amps and speakers.
Having measured a variety of cabinets (subwoofers and full range two-way) both series, parallel and series parallel, I found they had the same frequency response regardless of wiring. Frankly, I don't care about back-emf, other than when a load is too reactive for a particular amp to handle, and testing with the particular amp is the way to determine if it is a problem.
As mentioned in previous posts, don't mix different cabinet or speaker types in series, but that would apply to parallel too.
Have fun testing!

link Could it be possible that world powers and/or terrorists have found a way to implant suggestive thoughts into the population en masse? I know there have been declassified documents showing that the CIA was able to transmit words into the minds of their test subjects using microwaves. Sometimes things just pop into my head and eerily similar things occur shortly after. It would be foolish to assume the phenomenon to be anything other than subconscious manipulation. I have ADD and see thoughts very vividly. Most of the time my mind is static, like flipping through channels or radio randomly. Before I go into crazy town here are some things you should be aware of: Microwave auditory effect Pulsed microwave radiation can be heard by some workers; the irradiated personnel perceive auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus.[2] The auditory system response occurs at least from 200 MHz to at least 3 GHz. In the tests, repetition rate of 50 Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density instead of average power density. At 1.245 GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80 mW/cm2.[citation needed] However, competing theories explain the results of interferometric holography tests differently.[3] Electrophonic hearing Electrophonic hearing is the direct stimulation of the auditory nerves by external electromagnetic fields.[1][2][3][4] In 1962 Allan H Frey carried out a series of experiments which proved that microwaves can produce the sound even in those who are deaf.[1] The theory is unable to explain why only the sense of hearing is affected - though there are rare reports of people noting odd smells accompanying an aurora display Magnetoencephalography a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, while the SERF (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity[1] Synthetic telepathy/silent communication Synthetic telepathy/silent communication In a $6.3 million Army initiative to invent devices for telepathic communication, Gerwin Schalk, underwritten in a $2.2 million grant, found that it is possible to use ECoG signals to discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and in imagined words. The results shed light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants, and could provide the basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech.[40][86] Research into synthetic telepathy using subvocalization is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura. The first such communication took place in the 1960s using EEG to create Morse code using brain alpha waves. Using EEG to communicate imagined speech is less accurate than the invasive method of placing an electrode between the skull and the brain.[87] On February 27, 2013 the group of Miguel Nicolelis at Duke University and IINN-ELS successfully connected the brains of two rats with electronic interfaces that allowed them to directly share information, in the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface.[88][89][90] On 3 September 2014, scientists reported that direct communication between human brains was possible over extended distances through Internet transmission of EEG signals.[91][92] All above from wikipedia There are too many examples of various methods for sending signals to the brain for me to post right now. I know that none of this is new to most of you by any means. I was wondering if they have found a way to plant suggestive thoughts in such a way that only the extremely suggestible succumb to acting out on them. Doing it this way would be the more intelligent approach because they do not want the general population to catch on. Through various types of encoding via media using light and color patterns, through stimuli using microwaves, through auditory cues, magnetic pulse patterns, etc etc. it is definitely possible. I know a lot of people here have their dreams and predictions and claim to have "had a vision" or "had a feeling". Does anyone out there get that eerie thought that pops into there heads trying to goad them into things only to see something so similar on the news that it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand straight on edge? I'm talking big here. Kind of like someones broadcasting things to manipulate people in a very Inception like way. I think this has been going on for a very long time. I believe that there is a huge psychological war going on. Someones running interference to keep most of us safe. Save the poor fools who succumb to the slightest of suggestions. The technology is there so it is feasible. I just wonder who is "shielding" our minds. Maybe we are being fed all these chemicals and heavy metals for a reason. Maybe our being poisoned is what keeps our minds from being taken over. Could be the government is protecting us from other countries, even if it is just to keep us from tearing everything down around us. Or maybe another country is running interference to keep the world safe from our secret handlers. I had a vivid image of busy highways, traffic jams, and a militarized force wreaking havoc on said highways. Just had a bad feeling about it and thought I would post. Not really a dreams and predictions kind of person but sometimes I creep myself out. sorry to post and bail, just had to throw my thoughts out there in a somewhat coherent matter. edit on 17-8-2015 by theyknowwhoyouare because: (no reason given)

by: onebigpet Keywords: money , how , to , new If you're planning to start forex trading , you will need to first be taught forex trading fundamentals. With accurate information and materials, one can simply be taught the nuts and bolts of foreign currency trading and start earning a decent revenue. There are numerous factors that may help an individual understand this even higher. That now we have positioned this so low within the record shouldn't shock the experienced trader. Defective evaluation is never the reason for a wiped-out account. A profession that fails to begin is rarely killed by the consequences of erronerous software or understanding of fundamental or technical studies. Other points which are associated to cash administration, and emotional control are way more important than evaluation for the newbie, however as these points are overcome, and steady positive aspects are realized, the edge gained by successful analysis of the markets will likely be invaluable. Evaluation is important, but solely after a correct angle to buying and selling and threat taking is attained. 20. Do not surrender. Well Foreign exchange pattern trading is strictly as the name sounds. It is the course of by which you trade your currencies in accordance with the traits of the market. There's an precise science to this the place market watchers compile the data on what sort of trades the merchants are making they usually conclude what's "scorching or not" out there. Basically, Forex development trading entails the process of going with or against the gang on the trades that they've been making. If there is a sudden flood into one specific foreign money for instance, then there should be a purpose for this right? That is the logic of Foreign exchange development buying and selling anyway. The issue with the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market is that there is no market price that's the same for all brokers, because there is no central trade where bid/ask prices might be in contrast. Most brokers common the quotes from several massive banks, however these quotes can differ relying on the bank. The forex dealer then widens the spread for their very own revenue. That is the "market worth" that your dealer quotes. This is true even for those brokerages which can be promoting a no-dealing desk , where your quote, supposedly, is seen instantly by the taking part banks. However, the foreign exchange seller continues to be widening the unfold, for that is how brokers make their profits. Assist – Nice customer help and online trading go hand-in-hand. An important broker normally has an ideal help group that gives an excellent service. This generally is a highly beneficial function for rookie merchants who can use support providers to assist improve their understanding on buying and selling. Skilled merchants can profit from a highly responsive support group to assist make their trading expertise hassle-free. Be sure that your broker is accessible by way of LiveChat, e mail and phone to ensure a quick response when/if required. Foreign Change trading , or Forex , is the buying and selling in international currencies. Is Forex a rip-off? The foreign money markets are a big and liquid market, attracting speculative short time period merchants. International foreign money markets are dangerous and reliant on rumors, world news, and politics. Overseas Exchange markets have been described as a zero sum sport. There is a mounted provide of forex on the world markets and for one person to make cash on a Foreign Exchange market commerce , someone else should lose cash. A day dealer should deal with buying and promoting extremely liquid shares, because it hinges on the ability to purchase stocks and sell the same within seconds to minutes. Shares which have higher liquidity can be longed and shorted at a favorable value. The distinction between the bid and the ask value is known as unfold and it is dependent upon the level of provide, demand, and buying and selling exercise for the inventory. Greater liquidity also reduces slippage, which is the difference between the expected worth of a trade and the value at which it actually executes. All tendencies eventually fail. You can not rely on any trading strategy for assured earnings. Because of this, discipline is vital to your success. Never maintain onto a commerce once its criteria are not valid. In this case, if costs penetrate the pattern line, merely exit for a small loss and look for the next development. If you do not see a trend in a selected Forex rate, transfer on to a different foreign money. You'll be able to examine dozens of charts in search of traits, so the alternatives are many. These are three very simple guidelines that any forex trader can implement almost instantly throughout many pairs, with no reliance on technical indicators or sophisticated programs. Anybody can understand these guidelines. A dealer can use simple transferring averages to find out the primary pattern. Having no nearby support or resistance close by is perhaps one thing like one hundred pips minimum, or probably more, and you'll write this into your guidelines. Currency power or weak point will be simply measured on entry utilizing The Forex Heatmap®. Begin testing these guidelines first by demo buying and selling. I took a unique path, some may call it laziness however I frankly do not care. All I care about is to see returns on my funding with out studying tips on how to commerce from scratch for years. I invest my time looking for certified traders which have a track document and the talents to extend my portfolio safely every single day. There are traders all over the world with outstanding buying and selling abilities there is nothing mistaken with hiring or following a few of them and in return they take a small reduce, at the finish of the day everybody is completely happy. Not checking other time frames to precisely predict the market - I am not about to go into my spill as to how a lot I hate intra day buying and selling and the shorter time frames. However, many newbie forex traders will naturally be inclined to trade in 5, 10 or 15 minute time frames. Why? Nicely, I suppose as a result of earnings and losses might be realized extra quickly and there's https://youtu.be/6LS2nr_1Fe0 - Forex trading - a sense of feat and fast success when you find yourself trading inside shorter time frames. However, most of these people do not keep in mind the secondary trends happening with the every day and weekly charts.

""The evidence from woolworths just yesterday shows that there was a very significant impact on spending on the basics of life, such as school shoes, socks and jocks, polo shirts and so on,""He told abc radio. ""I think the evidence tends to indicate that many australians spent the economic stimulus package responsibly, and the benefit of that has been increased security and employment for many australians.

"The 3 Biggest Challenges On Social Media In 2015 0 SHARES October 15, 2015 Social Media 0
Social media marketing “trends reports” are usually exciting: new toys, bells and whistles. So, it’s actually refreshing when you come across a trend report that’s more honest in dealing with people’s problems. As much as we love having fun on social (stay tuned for our next blog post!), the new 2015 Social Media Marketing Trends survey and report from TrustRadius and Simply Measured is a must-read for this week.
Marketing Trends That Matter One of the dominant trends that came out of a 2015 poll of 600 social media practitioners is that doing social media effectively and with a big-picture perspective is tough – even for the pros. From consultants to CMOs to community managers, social media professionals are having a challenging time doing three things: Demonstrating the value of social programs. Integrating social media into the overall business. Discovering/developing the right set of tools to manage and measure social media activities.
TrustRadius’s polling included a wide sample of businesses of all sizes and social media maturity levels. For the most part, these challenges are equal regardless of size and maturity. (Download the report for demographic breakdowns.)
#1 Measuring ROI This has been – and continues to be – one of social’s biggest challenges. “60% of all respondents included it as one of the top three most challenging aspects of their social media program,” reports TrustRadius. Mid-sized companies (51-1,000 employees) and companies that self-identified as having an intermediate social maturity level were most likely to report this challenge. Recommended for You Webcast: Seizing the Data Crush Opportunity with Customer Identity Management
Perhaps one of the reasons measuring ROI is so challenging is that many companies get hung up on engagement (likes, comments, etc.), which is sometimes referred to as a “vanity metric” – that is to say, it doesn’t have a direct correlation with a sale. Read more about social media ROI.
#2 Integrating Social Media If multiple departments influence your social media strategy, you may find it difficult to identify the most important goals and stay on task pursuing them. Survey respondents indicated, “Brand awareness (71%),” “Drive website traffic (48%),” and “Audience reach/share of voice (38%),” as their top three goals on social media. Developing consistent goals and – in larger organizations – the influence to fully pursue those goals remains a major challenge.
#3 Managing Social Media The vast majority of businesses use just 1-2 software products to manage social media activities. Respondents favored native analytic tools (65%), followed by a social media management platform, such as Hootsuite (62%), and web analytics, such as Google Analytics (59%), as their top three tools. Most respondents believe they understood their social media audience – possibly a result of using the right set of tools.

Maybe I'm being dense but I'm not sure I follow you, perhaps we have slightly different definitions of what takeaway angle is.   As far as I understood there's a line going straight through the ball to the target and at a point around 6-12 inches back it simply measures where the clubhead has moved outside or inside in relation to that line.  Not half back, while it's still close to the ground and before your hips kick in.  Isn't that all there is to it?  It seems accurate for me in expecting it to measure that.  I'm typically 0-2* inside

MapCalculator - Measure Distance and Area on the map: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mapc...656219481?mt=8 MapCalculator helps to measure distance from point A to point B, compose complex distance paths or simply measure an area of a soccer field. Map Calculator is very flexible. The app allows users to have the center pin as the guide to compose the path on the map by adding and subtracting anchor points. The total distance (or area, if that mode is selected) is automatically updated. The user can save the path for future reference just by tapping the check mark and giving it a name. When saved, an offline map image is automatically generated (if internet connection is available) that can be accessed without internet connectivity later on. The user can also customize the paths visually by choosing from 5 different colours and line thicknesses. With some people being color blind, there's a color in there for everyone. Perfect for: - distance measurement for golf - flight distances for pilots - measuring distances on the water (boating) - land surveying - must have for any travel enthusiasts - finding co-ordinates of a point on the map The following measurement units are available: - Meters & Kilometers (Metric) - Feet & Miles (imperial) - Yards - Fathoms, Cables & Nautical Miles - Links, Rods, Chains - Acres for area measurement Several map types to choose from: - standard - terrain (shows elevation) - hybrid - satellite All units will also be used in area measurement, if that mode is selected. Device Requirements: * iPhone, iPod touch, iPad * Requires iOS 5.0 or later * 15.6 MB Pricing & Availability: MapCalculator is available in the App Store worldwide in the Utilities category for only $0.99 (USD) each. Promo codes are available for qualified reviewers.

Thanks JB it`s pretty complicated to explain every detail of the balance point, center of gravity,sweet spot, horizontal/vertical centers..Maltby does it in a variety of calculations...Iwas just trying to briefly give a idea...some of the info below is Maltbys definition of one of the aspects...The balance point I described is a simple way of describing the point.. of coarse the sweet spot is larger than a pin point...that`s pretty much a given..Jim So, for you guys out there that assemble clubs and have unassembled club heads lying around, here is how you check them out; Take a fine point sharpie pen and a ruler and put a vertical black line on the exact middle of the club face by simply measuring the face line length and divide that number by 2. Use a sharpened grease pencil if you do not have nail polish remover or acetone in the shop to wipe off the Sharpie mark later. Next, take an ordinary pencil, sharpen it and then cut or break the point back almost to the wood. Hold the pencil on a piece of paper and squiggle back and forth with the pencil held perfectly vertical to further flatten the point. Now, put the pencil in a vise with the graphite tip pointing directly up. Gently place the clubface on the pencil tip and move it around slowly until it finally balances on its own (most of the time it will balance on its own). When it balances, sort of press down gently and twist the head a quarter turn or so and lift it off the pencil. You should now have a fairly dark pencil mark which indicates the balance point on the face. This point is not the actual vertical center of gravity, but it is the exact horizontal center of gravity location. Finally, if the pencil mark does not fall on the vertical center line you drew earlier on the club face, then simply use the ruler to measure how far into the heel it is located and record it (rarely will you find it toward the toe, but sometimes it can be as much as1/32” or so out there).

"The 3 Biggest Challenges On Social Media In 2015 The 3 Biggest Challenges On Social Media In 2015 October 15,
Social media marketing “trends reports” are usually exciting: new toys, bells and whistles. So, it’s actually refreshing when you come across a trend report that’s more honest in dealing with people’s problems. As much as we love having fun on social (stay tuned for our next blog post!), the new 2015 Social Media Marketing Trends survey and report from TrustRadius and Simply Measured is a must-read for this week.
Marketing Trends That Matter One of the dominant trends that came out of a 2015 poll of 600 social media practitioners is that doing social media effectively and with a big-picture perspective is tough – even for the pros. From consultants to CMOs to community managers, social media professionals are having a challenging time doing three things: Demonstrating the value of social programs. Integrating social media into the overall business. Discovering/developing the right set of tools to manage and measure social media activities.
TrustRadius’s polling included a wide sample of businesses of all sizes and social media maturity levels. For the most part, these challenges are equal regardless of size and maturity. (Download the report for demographic breakdowns.)
#1 Measuring ROI This has been – and continues to be – one of social’s biggest challenges. “60% of all respondents included it as one of the top three most challenging aspects of their social media program,” reports TrustRadius. Mid-sized companies (51-1,000 employees) and companies that self-identified as having an intermediate social maturity level were most likely to report this challenge.
Perhaps one of the reasons measuring ROI is so challenging is that many companies get hung up on engagement (likes, comments, etc.), which is sometimes referred to as a “vanity metric” – that is to say, it doesn’t have a direct correlation with a sale. Read more about social media ROI.
#2 Integrating Social Media If multiple departments influence your social media strategy, you may find it difficult to identify the most important goals and stay on task pursuing them. Survey respondents indicated, “Brand awareness (71%),” “Drive website traffic (48%),” and “Audience reach/share of voice (38%),” as their top three goals on social media. Developing consistent goals and – in larger organizations – the influence to fully pursue those goals remains a major challenge.
#3 Managing Social Media The vast majority of businesses use just 1-2 software products to manage social media activities. Respondents favored native analytic tools (65%), followed by a social media management platform, such as Hootsuite (62%), and web analytics, such as Google Analytics (59%), as their top three tools. Most respondents believe they understood their social media audience – possibly a result of using the right set of tools.
What’s Your One Biggest Challenge on Social? Comment below, and let us know! You might even find a solution here…"

"13 October 2015 Abstract
Low-power flexible logic circuits are key components required by the next generation of flexible electronic devices. For stable device operation, such components require a high degree of mechanical flexibility and reliability. Here, the mechanical properties of low-power flexible complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits including inverter, NAND, and NOR are investigated. To fabricate CMOS circuits on flexible polyimide substrates, carbon nanotube (CNT) network films are used for p-type transistors, whereas amorphous InGaZnO films are used for the n-type transistors. The power consumption and voltage gain of CMOS inverters are <500 pW/mm at V in  = 0 V (<7.5 nW/mm at V in  = 5 V) and >45, respectively. Importantly, bending of the substrate is not found to cause significant changes in the device characteristics. This is also observed to be the case for more complex flexible NAND and NOR logic circuits for bending states with a curvature radius of 2.6 mm. The mechanical stability of these CMOS logic circuits makes them ideal candidates for use in flexible integrated devices. Introduction
The development of flexible electronic components such as transistors and integrated circuits is essential for the realization of flexible, stretchable, and wearable electronic devices that can be attached to a wide range of surfaces. Many different approaches for the fabrication of high-performance, flexible transistors have been reported previously using organic and/or inorganic materials 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Due to the processing challenges inherent in the fabrication of thin-film transistors (TFTs) on flexible substrates, most of these reports have focused on the fabrication of these devices, predominantly in deposition 10 , 11 , solution-based processing 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and printing methods 3 , 4 , 16 . For reports that do address the mechanical reliability of these devices, these have generally studied the characteristics of single flexible TFT devices (either n-type or p-type) 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 . However, in order to work towards the realization of low-power electrical devices, it is more appropriate to consider the performance of flexible circuit systems such as those based on complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) structures that integrate both n- and p-type TFTs, as opposed to simply measuring the performance of single devices. Several reports have been published that deal with the development of flexible CMOS circuitry, employing fabrication techniques including the film transfer method 1 or combinations of printing and deposition methods 2 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 : these reports present promising results for low-power logic circuits. However, the mechanical flexibility of integrated CMOS logic circuits have yet to be investigated in detail, although testing of standalone TFT devices has been widely reported 1 , 6 , 7 , 17 , 18 . In this study, we report the mechanical flexibility of CMOS logic circuits such as inverter, NAND, and NOR circuits to confirm that they exhibit near-identical electrical characteristics under both flat and bending test conditions. To demonstrate such behavior, flexible polyimide-based TFT devices using amorphous InGaZnO for n-type devices 10 , 24 , 25 and 99% semiconductor-enriched carbon nanotube (CNT) network films for p-type devices 12 , 24 , 26 were fabricated and incorporated into the aforementioned logic circuits. This study particularly focuses on the effects of bending on voltage gain and threshold voltage for the CMOS inverters, and the investigation of logic operations for CMOS NAND and NOR circuits. Device Fabrication
Figure 1(a) depicts the fabrication process of the flexible InGaZnO–CNT CMOS logic circuits. To form the substrates, a polyimide (PI) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was spun on a handle wafer of Si/SiO 2 and cured at 350 °C for 1 hour to form ~10 μm thick PI film. In order to improve the adhesion between the PI film and CMOS device components, a 10 nm thick SiO x layer was deposited on the PI surface by electron beam (EB) evaporation. For the gate electrodes of both InGaZnO and CNT TFTs, an aluminum (Al) layer (100 nm thick) was deposited using a sputter tool (ULVAC, Japan), and subsequently patterned using a wet Al etchant. For the gate dielectric, a 50 nm thick layer of Al 2 O 3 was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Arradiance, USA) at 200 °C using the precursors of trimethylaluminium (TMA) and H 2 O, followed by a SiO x (10 nm thick) film formed by EB evaporation. We have observed that the presence of the SiO x layer on top of Al 2 O 3 serves to enhance the CNT network deposition, which allows for the realization of devices with high on-currents and mobilities. To further increase the density of the CNT networks 12 , the surface of the SiO x layer was cleaned using oxygen plasma and subsequently chemically treated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. A commercially available 99% semiconductor-enriched CNT solution (Meijo Nano Carbon, Japan) was deposited for 20 min by soaking in the solution and rinsed with deionized (DI) water. CNT deposition and DI water rinse cycles were repeated up to 4 times to form relatively high-density CNT networks. The CNT network films were patterned by oxygen plasma (100 W) for 90 sec. Next, for the n-type channels, 30 nm thick amorphous InGaZnO films were deposited using a sputter tool under a chamber pressure of 13 Pa: this was achieved by controlling argon gas with oxygen gas of 6.4 sccm flow. InGaZnO films were patterned by a lift-off process. Via holes were etched in the Al 2 O 3 /SiO x layers using a buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF) solution, with subsequent deposition of source (S) and drain (D) electrodes (Cr/Au) carried out by EB evaporation and patterned using a lift-off process. Subsequently, a ~600 nm thick polymer resist (TSMR-V50EL; Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, Japan) layer was spun to passivate the InGaZnO–CNT CMOS circuit, in effect suppressing the strain effect under bending and preventing physical damage. Finally, the devices were detached from the handle wafer. Fig. 1(b,c) show photographs of the flexible CMOS logic circuit devices that were shown not to crack or delaminate under bending. Based on the surface morphology of atomic force microscopy (AFM) image in Fig. 1d , CNT network density is relatively low. By increasing the surface treatment and/or deposition time of CNTs, the density can be increased as the ones reported previously 12 , resulting in that the field effect mobility may be increased more. Figure 1: Process and strain distribution.

( d ) AFM image of CNT network film for p-type TFT. ( e ) FEM simulation plot modeling the strain distribution in the InGaZnO channel region under bending ( r  = 2.6 mm). Full size image Results and Discussion
To understand the strain distribution under bending, a finite element method (FEM) simulation was conducted. The simulation was only carried out for the InGaZnO film as the mechanical properties of the CNT network film were not known. We speculate that the strain distribution values of the CNT network films under bending are similar to those of InGaZnO; however, further studies into the properties of CNT network films are required to verify this assumption. As shown in Fig. 1(e) , under bending with a 2.5 mm curvature radius, the maximum strain in InGaZnO film is ~0.08% tensile strain: such a value may be small enough for the circuit to operate with no changes to its electrical properties. Further reductions to the strain in the InGaZnO film may be attained by using a thicker passivation layer: as observed from Fig. 1(e) , this would move the semiconducting layer towards the neutral strain region in the film stack.
The electrical properties of the InGaZnO–CNT CMOS inverter were measured prior to testing under bending conditions. The circuit diagram and a photograph of the fabricated CMOS inverter are shown in Fig. 2(a,b) . The channel length and width of both InGaZnO and CNT TFTs are 100 μm and 400 μm, respectively, and each current value was normalized according to the channel width. Figure 2(c,d) present the switching and output characteristics of both InGaZnO and CNT TFTs. InGaZnO (CNT) TFTs exhibit a relatively good I on / I off ratio of >10 5 (>10 4 ) at V DS  = 5 V and a peak field effect mobility of ~5.5 cm 2 /Vs (~2.2 cm 2 /Vs) at V DS  = 1 V. The mobility was extracted from the parallel plate gate model using a measured gate capacitance ( i.e. Al 2 O 3 /SiO x ) value of ~8.0 × 10 −4  F/m 2 . Next, the CMOS inverter was characterized as shown in Fig. 2(e,f) : the device exhibited a high voltage gain of ~45 at a driving voltage, V DD , of 5 V. Subsequently, the power consumption was calculated using the relation I DD / W  ×  V DD ( = 5 V) based on the results of Fig. 2(e) : importantly, the power consumption at steady state was found to be <7.5 nW/mm at V in  = 5 V and <500 pW/mm at V in  = 0 V owing to the off-current of two TFT components, ~10 −9  A/mm for the CNT and ~10 −10  A/mm for the InGaZnO TFT, values that are comparable to those previously reported for low-power consumption circuits 27 . As the operating speed, Fig. 2g indicates that the rise time of a CMOS inverter is ~0.75 ms by observing the change of output voltage from 0 V to 5 V. The rise speed depends on the FET geometry, and it can be faster by fabricating smaller device if needed. Figure 2: InGaZnO-CNT CMOS inverter.

( g ) Response time of a flexible CMOS inverter. Full size image
Mechanical flexibility of the CMOS inverters is characterized by measuring electrical properties as a function of bending radius, r , of the substrate ( Fig. 3(a) ). First, V out  −  V in at V DD  = 5 V was measured as a function of r , up to 2.6 mm ( Fig. 3(b,c) ). Although there are small differences for electrical properties between each measurement, the peak gain and threshold voltage are relatively constant as shown in the compiled results in Fig. 3(d) . This shows that the flexible CMOS inverter is not affected by the strain arising from substrate bending since there is no trend for changes in the electrical properties. This is in good agreement with the FEM simulation of strain distribution as discussed in Fig. 1(e) , where the strain in the TFT channel was observed to be small (~0.08%). Since the strain does not significantly affect the performance of the flexible CMOS circuits, small fluctuations for voltage gain and threshold voltage might attribute to a hysteresis of CNT TFTs ( Fig. S1 ). To prevent hysteresis in the characteristics of CNT TFTs, a more effective passivation layer is required, particularly one that can inhibit the diffusion of water molecules into the device 28 . To shed light further on the mechanical reliability of the flexible InGaZnO–CNT CMOS circuit, the device characteristics were measured whilst the circuit was subjected to up to 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius <6 mm: these results are shown in Fig. 3(e,f) . Again, although small fluctuations in electrical properties were observed, all measured characteristics including voltage gain and threshold voltage were measured to be relatively stable. These results convey that the fabricated InGaZnO–CNT CMOS inverters are mechanically flexible and reliable given the lack of substantial changes in functional properties on bending.

( e) V out  −  V in properties and (f) compiled results of peak gain and threshold voltage for bending cycle tests at r < 6 mm for up to 1000 cycles. Full size image
Considering that more complex circuitry than the CMOS inverter (NOT circuit) is required in many practical applications, CMOS NAND and NOR circuits were also fabricated and characterized under the same bending conditions as used for the CMOS inverter ( r  = 2.6 mm). These two logic circuits are described in Fig. 4(a–d) and used the same channel dimensions (length = 100 μm, width = 400 μm) as the CMOS inverter discussed above. Two voltage input signals (0 V and 5 V) of V A-IN and V B-IN were used with different frequencies of square pulses with an amplitude of 5 V to create every digital input signal ( i.e. 00, 01, 10, 11, shown in Fig. 4(e) ): for this digital logic circuit, input voltages of 5 V and 0 V are “1” and “0” signals, respectively. Firstly, the flexible CMOS NAND and NOR circuits were confirmed to operate correctly as shown in Fig. 4(f,g) . Furthermore, this also shows logic circuit operation under r  = 2.6 mm bending conditions, showing that the flexible CMOS NAND and NOR circuits, as was the case for the CMOS inverter, possess the same functionality under both flat and bending conditions. From these results, it can be concluded that complex logic circuits can also possess mechanical flexibility with at least hundreds of input operations confirmed by the experiment based on Fig. 4(e–g) . Figure 4: NAND and NOR logic circuits.

In this study, we fabricated the TFTs with relatively large channel length (100 μm) and width (400 μm). TFTs should be designed for the application depending on how high operating on-current and speed are required. In this platform, if higher parameters are required, several micro meter size for channel length can be used without affecting another performance such as I on /I off based on previous studies 12 , 17 . However, smaller channel length may be challenge due to the purity of semiconductor CNTs in the solution (99% semiconductor and 1% metallic CNTs) that creates current paths through the metallic CNTs between S/D electrodes. By developing high purity CNT solution, it may be possible to scale down further in the future.
In summary, we fabricated and characterized flexible CMOS logic circuits by comparing the properties at flat and bending states (up to r  = 2.6 mm). The results indicate that flexible InGaZnO–CNT CMOS inverter circuits are mechanically stable and function reliably, even after being subjected to multiple bending cycles. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that the more complex CMOS NAND and NOR circuits are mechanically flexible, with no device malfunction observed under bending conditions. Although characterization of standalone TFTs under bending conditions has been widely reported, this is the first demonstration of the operation of flexible CMOS NAND and NOR circuits under such conditions, confirming that such components are insensitive to significant degrees of external stress. We believe that this demonstration of mechanically flexible CMOS logic circuits opens the door towards realizing low-power, high-speed, flexible CMOS systems that are likely to be key components in the next generation of portable electronic devices. Finally, next step for the practical use of flexible circuits should be the developments of both highly integrated circuits with high reliability and low-cost process. Since the flexible devices target the macroscale electronics unlike Si-based electronics, the conventional Si-process infrastructure should not be used in terms of the fabrication cost. To address this issue, printing technique for the flexible CMOS circuits is an important role for the future flexible electronics. Additional Information

If you have a calliper you can measure the shaft.The d+ has a 3 inch parallel tip section un-cut.I find it works best to measure the shaft at 1/2 increments open the calliper then closing it snug where you want to measure rather than setting it at .335 and sliding it up the tip.This way you don't scratch the finish and you get a more accurate reading.When you get a reading or .336 you know that is where the tip section begins to taper.Then simply measure the distance from that point to the tip.I read on the team titleist forum that they do not tip the d+ shafts before installing the tip which surprised me.Hope this helps.G

Current intra/sub dermal electrodes don’t have the resolution necessary to accurately obtain and introduce meaningful information beyond simple functions. Cochlear and ocular implants rely on directly stimulating the nerves associated with those functions (i.e. cochlear nerve and visual pathways), and their resolution is already incredibly low and unrealistic. The brain itself knows how to interpret the stimuli from these nerves, but to stimulate the brain directly would require extremely accurate electrodes, and more importantly, extremely accurate images of how to correctly simulate inputs for that brain.
Interestingly, at my university, a professor was able to get a 12 yr old epileptic patient with sub-dermal implants to play Galaga, by thinking left, right, shoot, etc. However, these electrodes were simply measuring general eeg signals, and didn’t provide any input. Now imagine the level of calibration to introduce actual images/sounds/etc all at the same time. You would need huge amounts of data unique to each individual for how they normally interpret these signals, in order to even get somewhere close to replicating an environment.
TLDR: you are out of luck.
That said, I have thought that perhaps that if we can ever get to low resolution stimuli, maybe there is a way to get the brain to fill in details (such as with dreams), but given how little we understand about dreams and even just the brain itself, this is a long way from playing MMO’s with your friends.
One of the reasons our knowledge of neuroscience is so slow to progress, is that you can’t risk poking at someone’s brain very often. So enjoy your oculus and vive, and don’t get your hopes up any time soon.

"Solving the Social Media ROI Puzzle By Jason Cormier | October 15, 2015 Best Practices » Solving the Social Media ROI Puzzle
What’s the ROI connected to your social media strategy? If you’re being asked this by everyone from your boss to the board, you’re certainly not alone.
As part of Simply Measured’s 2015 State of Social Marketing report , Trust Radius was commissioned to survey over 600 marketers. When asked about the biggest challenges with social media programs, the top one identified was measuring ROI.
A close second was tying social activities to business outcomes, while the third was developing social media strategy. Is this any surprise to you? I’m betting not. As part of an agency that’s been helping companies with social media since the advent of Twitter, I’d also say anyone at Room 214 could tell you these responses have been the same for at least the last five years.
What Has Changed in 2015? Not only have social media budgets increased, but they’re now more likely to be specified within overall marketing budgets. We started to see this shift last year, but in 2015 even more prospects and clients came to the table with well defined social media budgets.
Of course, larger budgets typically come with larger requirements, or at least, greater expectations. The underlying message in all this is that social media continues growing as a marketing investment – and since that’s the case, it’s no wonder the question of ROI is just as relevant than ever.
A 2015 Salesforce survey of over 5,000 marketers helps support the points above: 66% believing social media is core to their business The same percentage having a dedicated social team 70% spending more on social media advertising this year compared to last.

The Truth Lies Somewhere in Between We’ve heard both extremes of the conversation. One clients says, “we don’t measure the ROI of social media just like we don’t measure the ROI of our accounting department. You just need to have these in place to run a successful business these days.” Wow!
Another says “don’t talk to me about social media until you can tell me how every dollar I spend is going to produce x amount more. Twitter Shmitter, and by the way, I don’t give a f___ about Facebook.” These are real conversations, btw
Return on investment shouldn’t be limited to measurement in dollars, but we all know life would be easier if we could get to just that. With this in mind, assigning (or agreeing on) a dollar value for a range of outcomes or metrics you’re tracking is highly encouraged. Consider how this might help you answer the social media ROI question when reviewing the four categories below.
Room 214’s Top 4 Social Media ROI Categories The short lists under each of these categories are by no means exhaustive. Hopefully, they’ll help you consider your own use cases — and how you might better address return on social media for your unique business/team/initiatives.
In summary, we view social media through four ROI categories:
1. Sales and Lead Generation : Many companies are focused on a pure social advertising play, so the majority of their content highlights direct calls to action (download, buy, subscribe, etc.)
When looking at social ROI through this category, we look to measure or track the following: Direct and assisted conversions Social referral traffic that drives a marketing qualified lead or sale Social engagement that results in a direct sale (think Curralate’s Like2Buy function on Instagram) Average customer lifetime value

2. Brand Awareness and Reputation : social media to drive traffic and visibility to owned and earned web properties. Think maximum positive exposure for your organization, “humanizing the brand,” the value of differentiation and thought leadership.
When looking at social ROI through this category, we look to measure or track the following: Impressions (still the connective tissue in marketing) Fan / follower / subscriber acquisition (social that drives email subscribers) Various engagement metrics (shares / reviews / survey participation) Influencers who advocate or contribute to the conversation around your brand Social engagement that assists in driving talent/employee acquisition Social that contributes to coverage on third-party sites (this gets into PR, but still applies)

3. Research and Innovation : Today’s leading social listening tools enable a vast array of current and historical insights derived from how people actually talk about things online — from the volume of conversation across social networks, to key themes and emerging topics of product/service/brand-centered conversations.
When looking at social ROI through this category, we look to measure or track the following: key business insights derived from social data (not saying it’s easy to put a dollar value on insights gained, but we’ve seen many cases of an organization pivoting for the better in this context) social engagement contributing to product development

4. Customer Service: Step 1 – admit you have a problem. Ok, maybe you don’t, so perhaps it’s just admitting you can do it better? Plenty of research points to around 90% of online buyers relying on customer reviews as part of their buying decision.
Regardless of how much customer service is an actual part of your business — when it comes to reviews, it’s often the most central factor. Your responsiveness and demonstrated care in this area, in general, is frequently magnified in social media.
When looking at social ROI through this category, we look to measure or track the following: Customer retention (could be connected to resolution reached in social channels such as Twitter) Positive reviews Survey participation

Some final tips in addressing the ROI of social media also include taking inventory of existing marketing, communications and business initiatives that may benefit from social media. Many of us have already learned silos are the enemy, and good marketing is a team sport.
Although it’s nice to figure dollar values for everything up front, plan on building in review times that allow you to (more accurately) assign values after the fact. This may be more relevant when considering social ROI in the context of research and innovation — but any kind of post-campaign review is better than none.
Finally, keep in mind this is not an exercise in mathematical precision. The main idea is to try, learn, iterate and get better. Tags: Room 214 Social Media social media ROI About Jason Cormier

"Quote: : thank you davidpriestley for your comments. I've never used pastel; I work only with oil. I will try to make the stancil with a paper card so I can put it upon my support and outlining it with a pencil. ain't sure if it will works.--- I'd like to take advantage of the occasion and make two questions: 1) I paint in a room and my single sourcelight is the daylight that comes in through a vertical 110x30 cm window. laying on a small table my still life setup stays in front and about 40 cm away from the window. now, if I turn on a lamp to illuminate better my easel and work-place it will be detrimental to my setup illumination? Personaly , I'd take a photo of the setup using just natural daylight, then just paint what I see in the photo.
That's what I did with this one.
I was in a cafe, about to eat a bacon sandwich and drink a mug of tea and I noticed that the whole setup with the light coming through the cafe window made a pleasing image, so I got out my camera (which I rarely leave home without) took a picture and then painted it at home.
Another way of doing it would be to place some sort a screen between your still life setup and your work area (easel) so that the light from your work area doesn't affect the light of your setup.
Quote: : 2) how far away from the setup must I stand to paint my still life objects in the same size they are in real life? It's not something I've ever really thought about before but I don't think it matters very much. If I want to paint something life sized then I simply measure the size of the object I'm painting and make corresponding marks on the canvas to ensure I paint it the same size.
Of course, detail should also be considered. the closer you are to the object the more details you will see in it, and I would personaly consider that a life sized object should have quite a lot of detail in it, so that would require you sitting fairly close to the setup... but really, that's a subjective thing, it all just depends upon what you are aiming for as a result of your finished work.
For example, with these two paintings I sat much closer to the second still life setup than the first because I wanted to put much more detail in it.
Word of advice, try not to think about it too much. As billmahler mentioned, practice is the main thing. Most artists would just set up the still life, find a comfortable place to stand or sit and simply paint or draw what they see without thinking about it too much. The more they do this, the better they get at doing it."

Something you mentioned in your post is that you cut open the tank to remove the rust. How sure are you that the tank will not leak and second has the tank been chemically cleaned with an anti rust agent to neutralize the corrosion and prevent the tank from continuing to rust?
After that Big Ups for taking on a project like this.
I have one yes and will be putting it to good use! Thanks for the support. You wouldn't believe the negativity that surrounds me on this project. When the time comes, and it will, I'll just be like
As for the tank, I got some guys to do it for me. I'm very confident it properly clean and sealed back nicely. I'm not sure about the chemicals though. Have to double check on that. Thanks for bringing it up.
Any ideas on how to mount the float? Or any layout/diagram of the fuse box?"

Quote from IVRUS I would never just look at the markings on a PICC and say.... Oh, it's all there... Some PICC's start their cm markings at the distal end, whereas others start their cm markings at the proximal end. Did you place 43cm? And is the PICC measuring 43 cm now that it is out? Okay, I'm cool with that. but how do you make sure the "tip is intact" as you put it? If you chart that very thing, you're setting yourself up for a losing lawsuit. How did you determine that? Was a microscope brought to the bedside and you verified that the tip was intact? Was the catheter cut at an angle, and now it is straight across...ooopppps. And, unfortunatly, some of the markings, aren't easy to see, or decipher. A 3fr IV catheter, has markings so timy, that ya' better have good eyes, or good bifocals to see them, heaven forbid I'm looking at a 1.9 or 2 french line. For the Groshongs, thankfully they have a black tip which is how you know, it's all there! The next time you pull one out...look CLOSELY at the tip...you will see that it is slightly rounded...that is how you know the tip is intact. If it is not it will look similar to the tip of an IV catheter...cut off. No microscope needed. If you are not checking the tip and just measuring it...then you are not doing your job (and in my opinion, not charting clearly) either because if just the tip has broke off you won't pick up on that if you just simply measure it, as the tip is too small..you have to LOOK at it. We chart the length it was put in, we chart what the length was when we started the removal and look to make sure all the numbers are there and chart, "PICC line secured at 6 cm removed with tip intact." In fact, this is the policy of how to chart it. You are incorrect that charting "tip intact" sets you up for a lawsuit. The tip is THE END. That is pretty definitive. The PICC lines that we use in our unit, the markings are clear, so there is no question of where it is. So that is why the MD didn't feel the need to measure it...because the tip condition is visible to the naked eye.

blugold - I know I like you. Your comments in this 108 page thread really convinced me that I had made a good purchase getting the Rescue 11. Maybe I'll stay a member but block out/ignore those I don't like. I can't explain the distance I get any other way than simply measuring it with a flight meter and using the R11's club technology with the perfect shaft for my swing. I hit all my clubs pretty long since employing a swing coach who's made my swing much more efficient and on plane. Hoping to get my hdcp down to zero next season if I stick with it over this winter. My goal is to make it onto the senior tour one day. I may try dialing my R11 down to 8.5 degrees tomorrow and see if I can hit it into the corn field beyond the range. I'll also try hitting my Rescue 11 off a tee and see if it equals the hype.

RT @simplymeasured: These days, #socialmedia accounts for 9.9% of digital marketing budgets: http://t.co/oTkcDUYCBl #smm http://t.co/hPaPzO…
An analysis of a multipractice quality improvement (QI) program in New Jersey found that full-scale, emergent practice transformation efforts don ۪t necessarily lead to quantifiable gains in targeted measures, even when the program is implemented successfully, according to a study published in the May/June issue of Annals of Family Medicine . The Supporting Colorectal Cancer Outcomes through Participatory Enhancements (SCOPE) study had aimed to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates through a mix of externally orchestrated, single-target interventions and practice-directed improvement efforts, but this method had a minimal effect on screening rates, explained Eric K. Shaw, PhD, of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick, and colleagues.    If improving performance measures for a preselected target, such as CRC screening rates, is the focus, perhaps a more traditional targeted continuous QI approach would be more appropriate, ۝ they wrote. SCOPE featured 23 participating practices in New Jersey that underwent observation and facilitation from study personnel. After this initial phase, practices were directed to form reflective adaptive process (RAP) teams, which would then drive the practice ۪s individual CRC screening improvement efforts.    A central assumption was that getting multiple stakeholder buy-in through this approach would enhance motivation and commitment to the change process, ۝ wrote the authors. Baseline data on CRC screening rates were collected, and then a 12-month follow-up assessed change in rates as well as gather qualitative data through surveys and interviews focused on the program implementation itself. Results showed that in the intervention practices there was only a small increase in appropriate CRC screening rates, from 49 percent to 53 percent, while a group of control practices saw screening rates drop from 43 percent to 38 percent, but Shaw and colleagues noted these differences were not statistically significant. The qualitative analysis revealed that not all practices were successful in fostering a climate of change throughout the entire practice, because of communication breakdowns or because team members didn ۪t feel    psychologically safe to take risks during the change process, ۝ reported the authors. However, successful implementation of the program did not always result in improved screening rates. Despite not leading to improved screening rates, Shaw and colleagues said the SCOPE trial offered some important lessons, including the observation that letting practice RAP teams choose their own objectives meant that some would focus efforts on other concerns not directly related to screening rates.    RAP teams that focused on poor communication or chaos in the practice viewed these issues to be of sufficient priority that they needed to be addressed before the teams could delve into concrete clinical improvements. ۝ RAP teams often featured a limited number of clinicians and communication of CRC screening goals tended to be poor. Also, the study facilitators were generalists with expertise in change processes, but the authors speculated that facilitators with expertise in the target condition could have more directly impacted screening rates.    Although single-target, incremental QI interventions can be effective, practice transformation requires enhanced organizational learning and change capacities. The SCOPE model of QI may not be an optimal strategy if short-term guideline concordant numerical gains are the goal, ۝ concluded Shaw and colleagues.    Advancing the knowledge base of QI interventions requires future reports to address how and why QI interventions work rather than simply measuring whether they work. ۝

Of course they are comparable. The overhead benchmark simply measures the number of draw calls that can be achieved on a given HW/driver stack in a given API. When one HW/driver stack performs much worse with one API even though another proves that the actual hardware is on par, then the only valid conclusion is that this given driver stack implements the other API far less effectively than its competitor. This would be true in a general case. In this specific case, we see the same GPU HW tested across different CPUs, and the HW that performs far better on the faster CPU performs worse on the slower one. Again, the only valid conclusion is that it is more limited by CPU performance than its competitor, and since the game's GPU load is vendor-agnostic this clearly points to driver API overheads. You arguments seem to boil down to "I don't want to believe this so I won't", even in the face of conclusive evidence. I can't help you with that. Also, no one said ""the whole AMD drivers have terrible overhead which causes terrible performance". What I said is that AMD drivers suffer from higher CPU overheads in DX9 and DX11 workloads, and particularly so in multithreaded DX11 workloads. And the references I've provided show exactly that.

"What Is “Dark Social” and Is It Something You Should Care About? 2015-09-09T11:53:26+00:00 Brewster Stanislaw
If you work for a social brand and have ever needed to dig into to a traffic source report using your favorite web analytics tool, you may have noticed a giant bucket of ‘direct’ traffic and thought to yourself what is this? Do you know where your direct traffic actually comes from?
Are that many people really typing in “ simplymeasured.com/blog/darksocialblogpost” into their browser? If it seems unlikely, that’s because it is. A large portion of this traffic is actually dark social . No this isn’t some kind of weird magic for the particularly boisterous wizards at Hogwarts. It’s a key term for any social marketer to know.
Originally discussed by Alexis Madrigal in his seminal Atlantic article , Dark social is traffic that originated from the share of a URL, but is marked as direct traffic in analytics tool.
To understand this better, let’s examine what ‘direct’ traffic really means. Direct is actually just a label for traffic that arrives at a site without a referrer. What’s a referrer you ask? It’s the URL a user most recently bisited before clicking over to the page in question. In search, this is simple: https://www.google.com/search?q=simply+measured+dark+social+blog+post .
Or often we’ll discover links on another site i.e. www.friendofsimplymeasured.com/this+weeks+top+posts .
In the early days of the web, everything was link-based, so we either discovered something via search, via link, or we went to the site directly by typing it into the browser or via bookmark. So if a site visitor arrived at the site without a referrer s/he had to be a direct visitor. But this was in the time of a simpler, smaller web, and before the rise of mobile. Times Have Changed
Unlike those early days, there are now many ways a visitor can arrive at a site without going to the site directly. Here are a few: Native Mobile Apps. Mobile apps either fire up a browser instance in-app (like Facebook) or force safari/chrome to open a new browser window (like Instagram) with the URL in question in the browser. In both cases, the browser itself is going to directly to the site and thus it looks like direct traffic when Email. Most email-providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook don’t pass a referrer when a user clicks the link to protect privacy and security for that user. Chat. This can be in the form of chat-based native mobile apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat or web/desktop based chat like Google Hangouts, IRC, or Slack. Chat clients of all kinds do not pass referrers either! Secure browsing. If you’re browsing on a site using HTTPS and click a link to a site using HTTP a referrer won’t be passed. Organic search. In some browser configurations, google won’t actually pass a referrer when a user clicks a link from an organic search.
We only consider the first three of these to be dark social, but the point here is that most direct traffic is actually far from direct. If you’re measuring your web traffic using only standard web analytics, you’re missing key insights about how people are actually discovering your content and products So Why Do I Care?
Programmatic ad buying platform RadiumOne estimates that ~70% of social shares are dark .
Think about that for a second. As a social marketer, social sharing is the lifeblood that sustains and amplifies your efforts, and it turns out you can’t even see that it’s happening in most cases. Imagine if the paid search didn’t know about 70% of their effective keywords!
The dominant sharing paradigm of today isn’t actually posting articles to Facebook (though that’s obviously hugely important). The use cases for dark sharing are so plentiful: A wife texting a husband about a concert she’d like to attend A group of friends on a group email chain sharing content about their favorite sports team A friend WhatsApp’ing a pair of shoes she’s going to buy A colleague Slack messaging a recent industry announcement
There are so many places where it makes more sense to share 1:1 instead of 1:many, and many times when a private forum is more appropriate. That doesn’t mean this sharing isn’t social! It absolutely is and you need to be able to understand it to both prove and improve the total efficacy of your efforts. So Now What?
Don’t be afraid of the dark! Start measuring it. A good first start is appending UTM parameters to the share buttons on your site i.e. &utm_source=sharebutton&utm_channel=facebook. This way when people reach your site via Facebook’s mobile app and other social apps that don’t pass referrers you’ll know they got there via a social share. But this method only takes you so far, in our data, we’ve seen that 55%-70% of sharing is actually URL copy/paste which means those UTM parameters won’t be there!
As Chartbeat has identified, native mobile apps will pass an identifier in the UserAgent field even when they don’t pass a referrer. For example, Facebook passes FBIOS as a UserAgent string for a user accessing content from Facebook’s mobile app.
Still these solutions only address the dark social sharing and traffic that happens on the mobile apps of major social channels, but not SMS, chat or email. Measuring dark social on those channels required a more nuanced approach that’s beyond the scope of this post.
Our new beta product is centered around conversion attribution and tracking dark social shares. If you’re interested, you can learn more here .

(like play with NOW stop loss ??) (i make my on... Ignored In terms of making trades or not making trades before news it really depends but if its major red news then it might be best to be avoided. As for the EA as I have always said it is simply a tool.... a tool which I use to assist me in making multiple entries on an M1 chart mainly but also other charts too. The larger the account relative to smaller lot sizes the better and more relaxed the trading but at the 'expense' of smaller net % gain. I continue to have very good cycles of trades on the pairs I trade when using the Q method. Here is my secret EURCHF [M1; 200 - 200/adj. 350* to 550*] - close some/all trades by applying discretion (as req'd) at DO, S+R, 00 numbers and key levels using PA EURGBP [M1; 200 - 200/adj. 350* to 550*] - close some/all trades by applying discretion (as req'd) at DO, S+R, 00 numbers and key levels using PA Note well: * means for cycles with a Q exit value =200 that look like potentially being closed out as losses (usually just before FF opens or a few hours prior, it does vary a bit) then I will look at the chart at alter Q exit to anywhere from about 350 to 550 using the trending indi as a guide but also an observation of the applicable chart (key levels etc). Monitoring the cycle of trades is paramount to controlling DD and remaining profitable! Other pairs ACad, AN, GU, UCad and several others. I also trade Gold [M5], GU [H1] and the volatile pairs such as EA, GA, EN, GN, GCad, GJ on the H4 TF but look for higher probability setups usually. SL and global SL levels have been explained in previous posts which means I calculate (determine) the average and maximum ranges for the trading window of interest, these are tabulated in excel on a day to day basis however many times these pip max ranges remain the same values until a new max pip range is generated so once the calculation has been done for the previous X number of periods/years then it is a very simple matter of applying the lines X_pips from the 1st entry and simply measure in the UP and DOWN directions and draw a horizontal line on the chart and that's where my SL goes. Currently EURCHF and EURGBP are traded anywhere from Start of day + 30 minutes/Tokyo Open for up to 3 cycles, if >2 pairs the lot progression size is reduced and so too the number of cycles...either 1 or 2 cycles depending on how early in the trading window the 1st cycle is completed. Most commonly applied trading window for EChf and EG pairs is from Tokyo Open through to Frankfurt - 1 hour. Trades that remain open beyond FF Open are carefully managed and closed out at key levels or at any level using common sense approach. Common sense approach means that I analyze each respective chart and make a decision to let some trades run, close them out at minor profit or minor loss as the case may be based on the current net gain of that particular cycle of trades. It may well be better to simply take a small loss on say 3 trades (provided the cycle of trades is net positive) than to risk a higher DD situation by allowing the trades to remain open beyond FF Open when DD will increase significantly! I monitor currently running cycle profits and cycle DD for each pair I trade as well as overall account DD. For the Tokyo start session through to say FF-1 trading window I apply >> 0.01lots per 10K balance but it depends on the trading day of the week and my overall view of the market. I urge you to demo trade the above 2 pairs with the settings I have given and if you apply some common trading sense you will make very respectable profit Perhaps set up 3-5 demo accounts but use the same 2 pairs say EChf and EG [M1; 200 - 200/350 to 550/manual] on each demo account but apply default lot size progression from 0.01 for demo account #1, 0.03 for demo #2 and 0.05 for demo #3 and run this for at least 1 week during the Asian session and for the 1st test week just set 3 cycles per pair. The next week get more involved and start looking at ways of closing out cycles of trades manually at key levels of S+R, DO line etc and analyze your trading data such as DD, net %gain, win/loss ratio etc perhaps use a TE or a myfxbook for 'better' data analysis...up to you. I am very happy with my progress using this method and will consider a TE or myfxbook very soon ps. success comes to those who work hard by applying the right knowledge at the right time for the right reasons All the very best,

"What You Need to Know About Facebook’s Insights and Analytics - wow, fantastic post via KISSmetrics: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/facebook-insights-and-analytics/

Kudos to Kristi Hines • Freelance Writer & Blogger!

In addition to a breakdown of Facebook's Insights, the post includes a review of several third party tools that offer analytics, such as Simply Measured, Sprout Social, AgoraPulse, Komfo, FanpageKarma, Socialbakers.com, and Rival IQ.

PLUS check out Wolfram|Alpha for getting metrics about your *personal* Facebook profile! It's free: http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook - this is very handy if you use your profile for some business/marketing and you want to know how well certain posts are performing, for example. I just ran my report and am amazed at how much data there is! Along with post insights, there's a ton of data about my friends. Hm.

Btw, in order to analyze your personal profile and get your report from WolframAlpha, you'll see the app needs you to grant this access:

""Wolfram Connection will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, email address, custom friends lists, News Feed, relationships, birthday, status updates, checkins, education history, hometown, current city, photos, religious and political views, videos and likes and your friends' relationships, birthdays, education histories, hometowns, current cities, photos, religious and political views and videos.""

Are you happy with checking your Page insights on Facebook? Or, do you prefer a third party tool? Also, will you try the personal profile analytics from WolframAlpha?

"New post - Hootsuite Grade Your Social - Measure Twitter Performance for Free
#Hootsuite, #HootsuiteService, #TwitterAnalytics, #TwitterTools


Using Twitter can be fun, but measuring Twitter performance can be real pain in you-know-where. Here is a real cool tool to measure your Twitter performance and get actionable insights to improve it. Hootsuite Grade Your Social - a free tool from the awesome team behind my favorite Social Media Management tool Hootsuite. I am using Twitter from April 2009, though started taking it seriously much later. At the time of writing this article I have 11.1 K followers on Twitter, not a single 1 acquired from any mass twitter buying schemes. But still the big number ""11.1K"" doesn't matter, if I am not using it effectively. Over the years I kept learning and implementing, hence improved a lot. But after using this Hootsuite Grade Your Social tool, I found out many more areas of improvement. Let me show you.

"When a perpetually mediocre team doesn’t end up contending, that isn’t hindsight – it’s data. It seems you don’t know the difference. Might I add, you are a blogger too. \nA GM’s job involves predicting into the future. Which already has a high degree of difficulty. Therefore looking back at results from a GM, all those variables of looking into the future must be factored in.
\nLooking at past results for patterns is just that. Looking at historical facts. Looking at results in the past, can be debated with context. That is not hindsight, that is simply pointing to a pattern and seeing if something is true or not with context.
\nI never stated that you can’t win a championship with tanking. I am saying that championships have been won in the past without tanking, and that is our debate.
\nThis debate between us, has nothing to do with the point of you using hindsight and saying that the context of why the ‘results’ are as they are is because of bad GM’s.
\nIN short:
\nLooking into the future right now, and predicting which college player will be a great NBA shooter is difficult to do, and looking back 5 years from now, it would absolutely be using ‘hindsight’ to say that a person already knew this, or could have easily been known in the present.
\nLooking into the past to simply measure how good or bad a shooter is in the NBA are simply facts with surrounding context that can be debated.
\nTwo different things. Sure, it is opinionated to say that GM’s suck from your side, and me saying that it is a systematic issue from my side.
\nFor proof, I offer logically, that we are BOTH fans and bloggers, and the people you are dissing are professionals at what they do with a very difficult job.
\nSaying that it is a systematic issue is simply admitting to the difficulty that exists from looking at this from a fan’s point of view (me) looking into our past results in our history.
\nBoth are opinions, you decide what makes more sense.
\nOn a final note, none of this means that Philly couldn’t win a championship in 3 years. My claim, is that with a fan’s knowledge, that there does not seem to be a link between championships and tanking.
\nIf Hinkie does discover something new, and his success in winning championships is repeated several times, then that would change the trend of history of what I looked up, then I would be forced to change my mind."

I just prefer the EOS60D , A55V files to others. I really dislike the Nikon D7000 colors are bad , noise is fairly low but odd NR in RAW effect in its NEF files........... The Pentax has a bit more detail and sharper image compared to the Nikon but a bit more noise. Over all though, the A55V has the best image quality in APS-C league. I don´t think it is a question about understanding my needs for my 5D II. It is a question about my preferences. I am impressed, if you can se differences in i.q. between the 7D, the 60D and the 550D. It is the same sensor only modified in the 7D for 4 read out channels. So if you like the i.q. from the 60D you should like the photos from the 550D as well. I think you can agree that i.q. is mainly depentent of the person behind the camera, and if we only make small prints and only look at the photos on smaller screens all good modern cameras can make very good pictures in good light. If we make print larger than about 8x12 inches (20x30 centimeters) then the quality of the lens starts getting more importent. If we make really big prints about 13x18 inches and larger only the very best lenses can take advantage of the high m.p. sensors in the 5D II and the before mentioned cropped cameras. I don´t disagree that the 5D II is able to make better photos than cameras with the cropped sensor, but talking about i.q. it is the least importent factor. and it is very important to note no APS-C is still not even close to the 5D2 or A900 in terms of over all IQ , especially considering much better color depth and tonal transition of FFs. also if you just simply measure amount of noise at ISO1600 in good light the Pentax K5 , EOS60D and Nikon d7000 produce good low noise files and compete very well against the 5D2 but they cannot hold it together in real bad light where you really need high ISO. so what is the point of having high ISO which is good only under studio light? do not become a victim of marketing gimmick (APSC already matched a good ff at high ISO kind). Erik00 wrote: My first digital SLR was the 10D. I changed this to the 5D which I later changed to the 5D mk,II. I am an amateur - shooting sceneries, family events, portraits, street fotography, macro etc. I live in Thailand and travel frequently here and in neighbouring countries, where the climate is mostly very hot and humid. As I am not young any more I wanted a smaller camera for travel than my 5D II. I would not buy a pocket camera, because I really appreciate the image quality from the big sensors inSLR´s. I know from experience that if my fhotogear is too big and heavy, I am not bringing it with me on many occations. So I bought a Canon 550D for the smaller size, weight and the build-in flash, but I expected to se some drop in i.q. compared to my 5D II. After having owned the 550D 5 months I realized, that I almost never used my 5D II, because I did not se the expected drop in i.q. when using the 550D. (I have some very good/excellent lenses.) I deceided to make a small real-life test, In good light, afternoon sun, I shot the front of a town house at a distance of about 20 meters. The housefront has large windows with many signs and posters. I shot 10 photos in raw with each camera. On the 5D II I used my Canon 85mm f1.8. On the 550D I used my Canon 50mm 1.4 so the photos could have almost the same f.o.v. Both lenses were stopped down to f 5.6 and from all reviews I have read and from my own experiance the chosen lenses have almost same resolving power when stopped down to f 5.6. I converted the sharpest picture from each camera in DPP and did a little ajustments and sharpening in Photoshop Elements. Finally I printed the two photos at A3+ (13x19 inches). At this size I could se no difference in i.q. Even when I enlarged the photos to 100% in my computerscreen, I could only se a marginal difference. Both photos looked very sharp i.m.o. My reasons for believing, that it might be correct, that there is very little difference in i.q. in prints up to A3+ (at least up to ISO 1600/3200) in real life use are: 1. Both cameras have a very high resolution sensor and i.q. is more dependent of the quality of the lens than the difference in sensors. 2. The 550D has (according to the reviews in DPR) a wider dynamic range than the 5D II. (8,8 ctr. 8,4.) 3. The 550D can have an advantage in i.q. if used with a high quality FF lens compared to a similar lens used on the 5D II. F. inst. I have the Canon 24mm f1.4 II L lens. When I use this lens on my 550D I have a f.o.v. close to a 35mm lens mounted on a F.F. camera. From all the reviews I have seen the 24mm performs much better on the 550D than the Canon 35mm 1.4 L does on the 5D II until the lenses are stopped down to about f 2.8. I am mainly thinking of vignetting and corner sharpness. This effect should be the same with most F.F. lenses, as the cropped sensor only uses the "best part" of the lens. I really want to know if there is a - real life - significant difference in i.q. between the two cameras. If there is, I will keep my 5D II and try to lern judging i.q. better. I would appreciate very much, if I can get response from skilled photografers who own both cameras or at least have been using both cameras for a certan period. Thank´s on beforehand Erik

"Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens at 70 mm Canon 430EXII Speedlite on-camera
To create the Polaroid frame, I simply measured 4″ in from the sides and top and 10″ up from the bottom of the foam core board. Then I cut out the square using an Xacto knife and 24″ metal ruler. Make sure you do this on a surface that you’re ok with damaging. If you don’t have a self-healing cutting mat, you can use another sheet of foam core board or a piece of plywood. I considered making more than one frame, anticipating it might get ruined during the course of the evening. The frame did get bent half way through the night, but it wasn’t noticeable in the photos and held up just fine.
For the backdrop, I used a long piece of 60″ wide duck cloth purchased at my local fabric store. It’s inexpensive and with the right lighting, doesn’t show wrinkles. I simply clamped this to my portable Backdrop Stand , and it was easy peasy. I had a small stool handy for taller kids or parents to sit on.
Now, for the lighting set up. I was originally planning on using two Speedlites with umbrella modifiers on stands but ended up going with one on-camera flash. I simply aimed the light slightly behind and above me to bounce off the ceiling. This technique worked very well and created much less of a tripping hazard like I had the year before.
The concept of bouncing an on-camera flash is largely what you’ll learn in our Lighting 101 workshop DVD . Bouncing the light off the ceiling, in this case, worked well because 1) the ceiling was white, 2) my subjects were relatively close to me and 3) I wanted a flat light illuminating the entire faces of my subjects.
My camera settings were as follows: ISO 500, 70mm, f/4.0, 1/80th of a second shutter speed with my flash on 1/4 power.
We had some fun props available for the kids to wear, which adds to the fun feeling of the whole thing. The funny 80’s slotted glasses are always the most popular. The reindeer headband gets second place (who knew?).
If you would like to learn more about bouncing on-camera flash for as easy, inexpensive way to light your subjects, check out the SLR Lounge Lighting 101 workshop DVD and our new Lighting 201 workshop , which delves into the details of shooting with off-camera flash."

"Are Manchester United really progressing under Louis van Gaal? By Peter Smith Last Updated: 09/12/15 8:40pm Are Manchester United really progressing under Louis van Gaal? Louis van Gaal insists Man Utd are heading in the right direction. We analyse their progress under the Dutchman...
Van Gaal conceded he was left in an indefensible position by Manchester United's dismal Champions League exit. But his defiant claims of progress jarred after another frustrating fixture for United supporters.
""We went further in the Capital One Cup [this season], qualified for the Champions League group stage, we have played all these matches and are still in a very good position in the league. The facts say we are better than last year.""
Are United really on a general upward trend? Have they really stepped up to another level from last season?
As the Old Trafford faithful prepare for Thursday night Europa League fixtures in February, we take a closer look at Van Gaal's assertions…
Premier League West Ham United earned a 0-0 draw against Manchester United - Van Gaal's side have had six goalless draws this term
There's no doubt, Manchester United are, as Van Gaal says, ""in a very good position in the league"". Just three points behind surprise leaders Leicester City with almost 40 per cent of the season played, United are in a title race few expected them to be ready for.
However, they are only one point better off than they were after 15 games last season. At the same stage in 2014/15, they were a distant third, trailing table-toppers Chelsea by eight points. This term, they are clear beneficiaries of surprising slip-ups from Premier League favourites Manchester City (who have already suffered four defeats) and Arsenal (three defeats), as well as Chelsea's wretched title defence. Danny Higgibotham refutes Louis van Gaal's claim that Man Utd have improved since last year
Of course, it all seems a substantial improvement on the days of David Moyes. After 15 games of the former Everton boss' reign, United were down in ninth, 13 points off the summit.
Yet, while United finished the 2013/14 season in seventh, they only managed six more points in Van Gaal's first season. Their 70-point haul earned them fourth - and Champions League qualification - in 2014/15. It would only have been good enough for sixth the previous year.
Add to that the growing frustration among fans towards Van Gaal's possession-dominated style - four 0-0s in the Premier League, no team in the top seven has scored fewer goals - and it seems a positive domestic campaign is not assured. Man Utd - Premier League goals per game Man Utd PL season rank Season 1.33
Champions League
Manchester United's return to the Champions League - thanks to a play-off win over Club Brugge - was seen as a significant milestone in Van Gaal's three-year 'transition' period at the club. Under Moyes, United missed out on European football for the first time in 25 years. At the end of Van Gaal's first season, normality was restored.
Yet there was nothing familiar about United's group-phase exit into the Europa League this term. ""You should really be cruising through that group and probably qualify with two games to go, resting players with the Premier League in mind,"" Tony Gale told Soccer Special . ""The old United would have done that."" Wolfsburg sent Manchester United out of the Champions League and into the Europa League on Tuesday
In fact, the United of 2013/14 were doing just that under Moyes. While domestically Moyes' men struggled, they cruised to a first-place finish in their Champions League pool, winning four and drawing two of their six games. Robin van Persie's heroics were needed to overcome a first-leg loss at Olympiakos in the round of 16 but a valiant defeat to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals was no embarrassment - a word used to describe United's group phase exit by former players on Tuesday. Champions League group stage - Moyes v LVG Season 63.29
Capital One Cup
It seemed odd for Van Gaal to cite United's Capital One Cup 'run' as evidence of their progress under his management. This season they beat Championship side Ipswich at home before losing on penalties to second-tier Middlesbrough after a goalless draw at Old Trafford. Granted, it was an improvement on the 4-0 defeat Van Gaal's United suffered at then-League One MK Dons in round two of the competition in 2014/15.
United's loss to Boro came in the fourth round - but they were granted a bye into round three thanks to their European qualification. Going two rounds deeper into the League Cup seems like a small step forwards at best. It's also worth remembering United were Capital One Cup semi-finalists under Moyes - and only a penalty shootout defeat away from making the final.
FA Cup
Manchester United face League One Sheffield United in the third round of the FA Cup and, after Tuesday's Champions League exit, Van Gaal picked the competition out, alongside the Premier League, as something the club will ""fight for"". A first trophy in three years would certainly be a significant sign of progress, should United go on to lift the FA Cup in May.
Last season, Van Gaal took United past Yeovil, Cambridge United (after a replay), and Preston before losing to Arsenal in the quarter-finals. Shots on target declining
In the first 15 games of the past four seasons, Man Utd's shots on target have fallen year-on-year. There were 90 in the first 15 games of Sir Alex Ferguson's season, 72 in David Moyes' first 15, then 66 and 54 under Louis van Gaal.
Players
Progress isn't necessarily simply measured in results. There have been many changes to the Manchester United squad since Van Gaal took charge. Around £250m has been spent on new signings, including a British transfer record fee for Angel Di Maria, who lasted barely a year.
In have come Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Victor Valdes, Memphis Depay, Matteo Darmian, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Sergio Romero and Anthony Martial. Angel Di Maria was signed for a British transfer record fee and then sold to PSG
Gone are Robin van Persie, Nani, Rafael, Javier Hernandez, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Shinji Kagawa, Danny Welbeck, Darren Fletcher and Wilfried Zaha.
Are United better off with the squad they have now? Van Gaal conceded earlier this week the playing staff still needs strengthening: ""I'm happy with my squad now but we can strengthen the selection still in [certain] positions, for example the left-back position is not so [well] covered."" After they were knocked out of the Champions League, Danny Higginbotham wonders how this will affect Manchester United's January transfer window plan
Conclusion
In terms of points, Manchester United are little better off in the league this season than they were last. The fortunes of teams around mean they are closer to the summit. Their return to the Champions League ended in disappointment, falling well short of their performance in the competition two seasons ago. There is yet to be a dominant domestic-cup competition victory over a major team in the past two seasons. The club has spent £250m on a high turnover of playing staff.
Louis van Gaal is adamant progress is being made. With seven league titles and a Champions League win on his resume, plus Premier League and FA Cup honours still up for grabs, his assessment cannot be dismissed. But the evidence to date suggests there's a lot more progressing to be done. B'mouth vs Man Utd"

Posted by Victoria Strauss for Writer Beware This week I've got another great guest post for you, from marketing expert Chris Syme. We writers have all heard that we "have" to be on social media, which is presented to us--both by experts and the not-so-expert--as the Holy Grail of marketing and self-promotion. But apart from the thorny questions of which platforms to use (Twitter? Facebook? Pinterest? Some of them? All of them?), and how to use them (How often should we post? What's the proper mix of friendly interaction and self-promotion?), there's the problem of "services" that want to exploit our confusion to rip us off. Read on for solid advice on how to separate the worthwhile from the worthless, and warnings about some common social media scams. Social Media Snake Oil Comes In All Shapes And Sizes by Chris Syme Authors want to sell books. But most indie authors know very little about how to promote their books. And when it comes to social media, authors everywhere are throwing up their hands. Is it a waste of time? Do I need to be on Twitter? How often should I post on Facebook? I get email from authors who are frustrated. They see social media as a minefield and don’t want to step in for fear they will never come out. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is just buy that package of hundreds of tweets for twenty dollars and cross your fingers hoping that somebody will buy your book. After all, everybody says you have to be on Twitter, right? We hear words like platform, brand, discoverability . How can an author break through the firehose of noise on the Internet and decide what, if anything, to do? Separate The Wheat From The Chaff My husband is a grain farmer. Every year we pull out the massive combine and dust it off, getting ready for the magic of harvest. Gone are the days when workers had to beat the grain shocks by hand to separate the wheat from the chaff. These days, those big expensive machines cut the wheat and feed it through a mechanism that separates the grain from its stalk The stalks are chewed up into chaff and spewed out the back of the combine to be absorbed back into the soil. In marketing, we need to do the same. We have to learn how to separate the snake oil from the good stuff. Authors should want to learn how to spot a worthless marketing scheme. But there’s a learning curve. And sometimes that Facebook ad that worked for your friend isn’t going to work for you. This is where education comes in. The book marketing sector, more than any I have ever worked in, is full of bad marketing advice. My objective here is to help you separate the wheat from the chaff -- to be able to spot snake oil when you see it. It’s The Principle Of The Thing Every business sector has best practices. It’s possible to circumvent those and get a modicum of success, but that is an anomaly. Social media marketing has basic principles of success. They aren’t rocket science, they are based on data. Take this example on hashtags. In early 2014, Dan Zarella, a social media data researcher for HubSpot , found that if hashtags are used in a tweet (# -- a pound sign -- followed by a phrase of reference that is followed by many people), that tweet is 55 percent more likely to be retweeted than one with no hashtags. His results were based on mining data from over one million tweets. So, people jumped on the hashtag band wagon. The more, the better, or so people thought. In 2014 Buffer, another reliable social media research company, published data that showed that after two hashtags, engagement of a post actually goes down (graphic courtesy of Buffer). This is a principle that most savvy marketers take for granted now. But there are some unethical snake oil salespeople out there telling authors that the more hashtags the merrier. They didn’t get the memo on too many hashtags tanking engagement. And, for a mere $19, you can buy a day’s worth of tweets loaded with hashtags from beginning to end that promise to hike your books sales. Here is a sample ad: Not a day goes by that I don’t see this scam retweeted by several authors, maybe because they promised to help promote the service for more free tweets that will “reach millions of people generating a truly astonishing amount of traffic.” All these hashtag-laden tweets do is annoy people. To the savvy social media user, they reek of stupidity. The outlier may sell a few books, but I wonder how many more books that person could have sold if they had used their money wisely. Another popular Twitter scam offered by more than one company offers authors hundreds of thousands of followers worth of exposure for your tweet for a fee. I experimented with one of these snake oil outfits recently just to test it. I knew I was blowing my money, but it was a mere twenty bucks to prove my thesis. This company boasts three different Twitter accounts with 375,000 followers. I want to add that it is fairly easy to amass Twitter followers if you know what you are doing. For instance, this particular company is supposedly followed by LeBron James, according to the report I ran on their followers on Simply Measured . But the real LeBron James only follows 184 people. So, on a whim I looked through them all. This company was not there. And, their fake LeBron James has only three million followers while the real King James has 23 million. This LeBron James page is a fake account built to fool people into following. It has been followed by millions of people who think it’s the real thing. These fake accounts automatically follow back so other unscrupulous people can amass large follower counts. It’s a well-known racket in marketing circles. Fake follower companies search diligently for these auto-following accounts to increase their fake reach. (Did you notice I use the word fake a lot?) Also, an analysis of this company’s top 20 influencers did not produce one account that would be in the market for my books. My $19 produced zero sales and zero new Twitter followers. Maybe I should have spent more money. But alas, here’s a review of their service from an author who purchased five days worth of tweets . Also no sales. Scam artists know what they are doing. They are playing on peoples’ pain points and ignorance. They can build fake followings completely on accounts that follow back automatically. Keep in mind that all you need to start a Twitter account is an email address. It’s an ugly, dark business. There is no verification to make sure that real people are setting up accounts. These companies abound on the internet. Hint: if the website looks rinky-dink and boasts of millions of daily impressions from loyal fans , beware. We Will Promote Your Book…For A Price There are more bad promotion sites out there than you can shake a stick at. How can you tell the difference between the good, the bad, and the ugly? Many of them have slick websites, Facebook pages, and multiple Twitter feeds boasting of thousands, maybe millions of followers. Here are a couple pointers to help you make up your mind. 1. Good sites: There are many sites out there that are based on good marketing principles and have a large audience of both authors and readers. They validate their expertise with blog pieces, authentic peer recommendations, podcasts, books they write, webinars, speaking engagements, and they can prove success by numbers over a long period of time. Not everyone in this category is spot on when it comes to social media strategy, but most are trying. The resource may be membership-gated such as Jim Kukral’s Author Marketing Club (I am a member), Where Writers Win , and others. They usually offer a subscription at a reasonable yearly price and offer a large variety of tools to help authors succeed. The large variety of marketing tools is a key. There are also many knowledgeable marketers that cater strictly to authors such as Penny Sansevieri’s Author Marketing Experts , Joel Friedlander’s The Book Designer , and Book Marketing Tools . In the good category are also author forums like Writers Café (KBoards) and The Alliance Of Independent Authors (I am a member). Forums like these are populated by authors and are a good place to get recommendations and reviews for everything from editors to marketing services. There are also a number of authors out there that share their validated expertise with other authors through a combination of free resources and pay-per webinars and classes. Joanna Penn and Jane Friedman come to mind. 2. Questionable sites (the bad and the ugly): It is impossible to list all the suspect author marketing services out there but I do write about them often on my agency’s blog for authors . These sites ask for money for their suspect services. There is no information on their “about” pages that validates their expertise or existence, just blabbing about the reach of their audience. They are not published authors or even legitimate marketing services. They are product-only. Beware of offers like this one from Contentmo . Besides the fact that their website design is a red flag, their claim that they have 23 million impressions a month on social media is irrelevant. There is no explanation or proof of who or where those impressions come from other than a list of their interconnected Twitter feeds and low-volume Facebook pages. Another red flag here is the absence of real people’s names in the About section of their site, a Gmail address as a contact, no address or location information, and their testimonials are suspect. I am also wondering why a company that brags 23 million impressions a month has only 167 likes on their Facebook page. Many sites in this category have some free services. If you want to give them a try, keep track of your results. I recommend recording results with every marketing strategy you try. If they are free, give them more than one try so you can make sure your initials results were correct. Free is okay but you often get what you pay for…nothing. The world of social media marketing is a quagmire for many authors. If you’re just not sure what to do, I would recommend starting with self-education. I have a list of resources (mostly blogs) on my website that I personally recommend. The more educated you become, the easier it will be for you to spot snake oil when you see it.

"I study history at the best department in the country. Durham. Just saying. who cares
you still won't get a job… http://www.york.ac.uk Yoxbridge…
OK, above I commented that I dislike Cambridge students' attitude – they should realise that they owe their place to luck as much as skill.
But equally, those Durham (or very often LSE) students who keep pointing to rankings and say 'we are the best department for x' are very annoying. This may well be true, but in the end, Cambridge is Cambridge, and you cannot beat the prestige of the name. So stop trying, it makes you seem like you have a chip on your shoulder. Thom
So…instead we're just supposed to allow Oxbridge people to brag about how utterly wonderful they are and not point out that the evidence isn't always on their side? I mean, ultimately, it'd be nice if no one felt the need to boast about the superiority of their university, but I think it's a bit much to say 'don't even try to answer Oxbridge people even with reasonable arguments'. That's hardly what an education at any university is supposed to teach you. http://www.york.ac.uk Yoxbridge…
No, you should not let them brag. But the answer shouldn't be 'but our uni is just as good!', because though it may be true in some cases, in general everyone knows that Oxbridge is the top.
The right response is 'yes, Cambridge is a great place, but the fact that you got in doesn't mean you are smarter or better in any way than those who went to Durham'. The problem with those of us who went to the safety choices – Durham, Warwick, LSE, Bristol, York etc – is that we have the chip on our shoulders; the problem with Cantabs is that they are (unjustifiably) arrogant. State School Kid
Justifiably. We work HARD. Yes even the posh kids from silver spoon in mouth land. You wouldn't survive otherwise. Sort your complex out mate. http://www.york.ac.uk Yoxbridge…
Allow me to repeat this again: I have studied at Cambridge, and do not assume that we don't have the same workload as graduate students. I have seen life at two unis, not one. And in fact, I have met people from far worse universities than either Cambridge or York, who are exceptionally smart.
It amazes me that students at such a great university, who should remember to be humble and to exercise critical thought, are so fanatic and stupid as to say 'I got in, you didn't, therefore I'm better'.
But you know what, there's no way I will change your mind. Hopefully this will happen when you get out to the real world, and see that no-one cares about where you studied (yeah, I get a few wows when I say I studied at Cambridge, but do you think it changes the way people view me? Of course not). You will also then mix with students from other unis who may be better than you in your field. I hope you manage to deal well with this when it happens. And Lancaster
apparently has the best physics department in the country. Doesn’t mean Lancaster’s the best university or even close, although I did have it as one of my back-ups. Being consistently top or 2nd or occasionally 3rd, in every single subject across the board, is what makes Cambridge better than Durham. Elizabeth Windsor
Don't even know why this subject is beig debated, Buckingham has the best graduate propects; FACT. I guess
it’s full of mature career-developers, not I-haven’t-even-set-foot-on-the-career-ladder-yet-ers, so not really comparable to all other unis in the country. Germaine
This is gospel truth. There was this lad in my form at school who was seriously retarded. I know that's a bad word, but it's the only appropriate one to this case. In all the bottom sets, a great dopey P.E. enthusiast, a bit moon-faced – the works. We went to different sixth form colleges (natch) and through the wonders of Facebook I learned that he holds a degree in Psychology from… DURHAM!!! 'Seriously retarded'
And I had a great time. Cheers Tab
Yes, we are all very proud to have got in, and most of all relieved that we don't have to spend the rest of our lives justifying why we didn't. The gentlemanly thing to do is to only discuss this elitism in private. You don't need to mention the elephant in the room with outsiders. Durham
Some people apply to Durham as their first choice and don't apply to Oxbridge because they don't want to be with snobs like you. cantab
You still have snobs, just snobs that didn't get in to Oxbridge. Keep up. http://www.thebubble.org.uk Thom
""Durham simply does not have the sheer amount of work, and dare I say it intellect, required at both Oxford and Cambridge."" My immediate response is 'we also don't have the ignorant stuck-up elitists', or to point out that Durham has been ranked better than Oxbridge for some subjects, including my own when I was an undergraduate, but sadly the former part wouldn't be true. However…seriously, way to conform to the elitist Oxbridge reputation (and I say this as the child of two Cantabrian parents). That girl who rejected Oxford (see BBC News today) was right. If this is how you're going to act I'm rather glad we're not part of your Sacred Club. On a wider point, can we not just have universities, without having ridiculous elitist clubs within them? Nearly every university has its good points.
Oh, and some of the people commenting here are either trolls or have just proved they don't in the least deserve to be anywhere near Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, or any other halfway decent university. Troll
Trolls? On the Tab? Say it isn't so! Off you go
Um, if you don't like the comments, why don't you just click the shiny x in the top right hand corner? This is a tabloid newspaper aimed at Cambridge students. Don't you think it's going to troll other universities in ways that don't reflect the views of the majority? Neutral
Oxbridge: beautiful places, hideous people. Durham: beautiful place, retarded people. Solved. embarrassed
All these prejudices are why I never tell people where I go to uni… if asked I always tell people I'm at uni ""somewhere down south… not too far from London."" Admittedly, I am Scottish – to tell the truth would mean being burnt as a sassenach on top of the usual assumptions… Anonymous
If that's the kind of attitude Oxbridge has, why on earth would Durham want to be associated with it? Sure, Oxford and Cambridge have some departments which rank higher than Durham, although the vice versa is also true. But at the end of the day, they are all elite Universities. Hence, we are all intelligent and educated people, although you wouldn't think it by reading some of these comments. GGG
You are right mate, this whole article and the comments are shite. Sadly, there is a real culture of insularity and elitism at Cambridge. The stereotype isn't so far from the truth. All very well commenteers making the state school/private school distinction, but there are massive differences between the state schools most Cantab state schoolers come from and the state schools at the bottom which send very few to Cambs… This article and some comments are typical Cambridge 'lets talk about shit just to make ourselves feel great again,, we're at Cambridge, they're not, kaboosh'. Nope
Everyone at Oxbridge is stuped Anonymous
OH come on…get a grip. It's two very inferior 'writers' trying to provoke fury with their frankly terribly written articles. Meh
And the lack of library all-nighters is a bad thing? Durham is worse than Oxbridge, and therefore is more fun, less socially-inept, and easier to get at first at. True, an Oxbridge first is worth more than a Durham first, but probably not worth working three times as hard…
Who cares anyway? People need to get over not getting into Oxbridge, shit happens. Mr Blobby
It's all about what you make of it. You can get firsts across the board from either Durham, Cambridge, Oxford or any other similar university you care to mention – what MATTERS is whether you make your time at these institutions count. If you're a decent person who puts their all into the university experience (social AND academic) then there isn't much anybody can say against you.

How the hell did you get into Cambridge? At least research your article you idiot. It's riddled with basic inaccuracies. dts
all universities are elite if you have to pay £9000 a year for them Shazza Babe
Wow, Reanne. Your small minded, rude and unfounded excuse for an article stands as a real testament to the 'Cambridge difference'. In all honesty if everybody who goes to Cambridge is like you I would rather spend three years of my life burning myself with lit cigarettes. sfw44
Oxbridge are the top, no questions. I went to both Oxford and Durham. Durham was by far my favourite. Oxbridge fine without the D. D fine without the Oxbridge. Durex
Doxbridge? I prefer the amalgamation of Durham and Exeter. Anal Play
Newsflash geeks! York have joined the annual Doxbridge sports frolic in Dublin, which makes it Dorksbridge- let's leave it at that. Jane
Having studied first at Durham then at Cambridge (Post-grad), I can safely say I'm glad I turned down an offer from King's College Cambridge the first time round! Too snooty by far and the interview was a joke!!! Durham suited me better at the time and I loved it. As for academic standards, I think Durham's recent ranking speaks for itself. Not everyone can hope to attain entry to the 'dreaming spires club', nor should they feel stigmatized for being an 'Oxbridge reject'. I applaud the girl who turned down Oxford in today's news!!! I read a lot of shit
I have never read a bigger load of shit than that girl's letter. Realism
Oh, please. Your smug ""inverse"" snobbery is greater than any snobbery you would have encountered here. I went to an open day at Durham, and it looked pretty good, but it still wasn't even my second choice.
As a former state-school pupil, I can honestly say I have never felt intimidated by the formality here or by the amount of privately educated students. I wish people like you and the girl who wrote the letter could get your heads out of your own arses long enough to see that Cambridge is the opportunity of a lifetime. Your choice if you decide not to take it, but I'm glad I did. Mandem
The girl who ""turned down"" Oxford is obviously an example of someone that can't take rejection…she applied to the same course the year before at Cambridge and got rejected. Her fate was probably already decided for her so she saved her pride by ""rejecting"" Oxford, in the knowledge she would get rejected if not. Just another bitter reject, like some of the Durham people on this post. Keith
Isn't Cambridge way better than Oxford? It's always way ahead in the rankings. Durham and Oxford are much closer. Maybe there ought to be a new rank of second-rate universities: Doxford. DippyToffs
Oh my dear sweet god….grow up and be proud we can even have this chat! if you didn't have the good education/ parents to pay for you, we'd all be reading Business at UWE/ the nearest place to a roof over our heads.
You all are so privileged to be even able to have this conversation! Bet you Mary at home studying with the OU for a BA in English Lit has more intelligence than any member of this joke of a commentary.
If you are the first member of your family to get F.E. and went to any of these places, you are incredible and shouldn't be joining the elitest chat that forms the basis of this chat.
If you are having your degree paid for you by mummy and daddy, your opinion holds zero value to this chat. Anybody achieving more than B,B,B at A-Level deserves a good education. Go and see how the other half live. Cantab
I am the second in my family to go to university – the first was my brother, also at Cambridge, and I promise you he didn't pay for any fancy school. I have great respect for the OU, especially those who do a degree whilst working full time. But Durham can still fuck off. Why
do you keep saying chat?
It gets so tiring being told that our places here were bought for us. I went to a state school, I got in to Cambridge because I worked hard and I'm good at what I do.
Mummy and daddy aren't paying for my degree, but even if they were my opinion would still count. Rich people aren't just disqualified from making arguments.
Why do you bet Mary has more intelligence? If she has, why isn't she here? If money is an issue, she could get the £3400 a year bursary open to all Cambridge students. This is more than enough to live on, when combined with a student loan.
To write off everyone's achievements just if their parents were lucky enough to receive F.E. is pathetic inverse snobbery, the sort of bitterness that every Cambridge student sadly needs to get used to. But I suppose going to the best university in the country makes up for that a little.
Cunt. Cheif
*I got into Cambridge cos I'm a clever fucker and had to do fuck all at school so what?
So, my ""mummy and daddy"" are paying for my degree. I consider myself bloody lucky that they put the money away while I was growing up and that they're in a good enough place financially that they can support me. I'm only the second person in my family to go to university, and when I got the chance to come to Cambridge my parents were determined to see me do it without taking out a loan if possible, as coming from working class backgrounds they don't believe in taking out a loan if you can possibly avoid it. They also cover my college bills and all my living costs. I still come from a state school, and I'm far from posh (I'm from northern Scotland, it's about as far from it as you can get). Does that mean I have ""zero value""? I think it means I'm incredibly lucky, but it really is about merit here, and I've never once felt it was an issue that my parents pay for me and yet my best friend gets a full bursary.
On the issue of Doxbridge – there's no denying there are very intelligent people at other universities, it's just stupid to disagree. However, Oxford and Cambridge must sit so much higher in the world rankings for a reason – and probably because of the vast numbers of very good applicants they get. That doesn't mean an individual from Cambridge is necessarily any better than an individual from Durham, even one who got rejected, but that Cambridge and Oxford are universities that are really on the world stage, and we're lucky to be here and benefit from that. Justin
Doxbridge is silly…what makes Oxford and Cambridge people arrogant is their supervision/tutorial system…Durham can't join the club until they manage to get the resources to organise a supervision/tutorial system… bradstow2
Not only is this article entirely unnecessary, it is amateur in its style, and lacking in any kind of fact or real information. What claims do the authors have to any kind of respect for their Meisterwerk? Who wants to compare ANY two of the three universities anyway? Redundant, superficial, boring. The resulting comments merely demonstrate the lack of maturity (and vocabulary) of the readers. Classic Durham
Who needs to be at Oxbridge when Daddy can make one phone call and get you a job? Durham
They should have called it Coxford… 1778
How did I get to this shit from minecraft?!!? A few things…
1. Any argument about the proportion of students at Oxbridge that went to private schools meaning that Oxbridge is inherently 'snobby' is stupid. Durham has a much higher proportion of private school students, and, as someone who has many friends there and has visited often, I'd say the place feels much, MUCH more 'public school' than Cambridge, and probably Oxford too.
2. People who don't get into Oxbridge often seem to make arguments about intelligence. 'Oh, I'm just as clever as people who get in to Oxbridge'. Since when were Oxbridge interviews simply measures of intelligence? There is no IQ (or EQ) test as part of the admissions process. Sure, they want clever students who can get the grades, but they also want people who are interested, teachable and hungry for an offer to study there. Intelligence in itself does not a Cambridge student make – nor do excellent A level results. Many people come here for postgraduate study from other universities who were perhaps just as clever aged 18, but hadn't yet developed these traits.
3. In terms of the workload, there is simply no comparison between Durham and Cambridge. For this reason, I simply don't believe that you can assert that a 2:1 at Durham is better than a 2:2 at Cambridge. Far more is required of you in order to achieve even a modest class of degree at Cambridge. That's not to say that there is a difference in ability or intelligence: it is a question of the difficulty involved.
4. Fun – depends what you consider fun to be. In terms of extracurricular stuff like theatre or music there is far more going on in Cambridge, in my experience. In terms of how often you can get totally smashed, Durham blows Cambridge out of the water. But perhaps the willingness to sacrifice immediate short-term fun for a long-term benefit is something that sets Cambridge students apart (even if they don't often have much of a choice) Durham
To be honest I don't think that many people from Durham care about not going / not applying to Oxbridge. Obviously looking at this post there are a few who seem bothered or are just enjoying provoking Cambridge students (always fun).
In my opinion Durham is the perfect balance of being a very well regarded University whilst not being as much of a ball ache as Oxbridge in terms of work. It is significantly better at Sport, and from my experience has a much better social agenda. Finally if you leave here with a half decent degree you won't be working at Tesco.
Depends what you're looking for really. Anyway, I'm off out to Boathouse, enjoy your all nighter in the Library you Oxford elites. Jane
To anyone interested…. at Durham they DO have a supervision/tutorial system the same as Oxbridge, at least my course 20 years ago did, and lectures were not compulsory. The terms are also 8-9 week come to think of it.
At the end of the day, it's what you gain from the experience and what you do with your time there and afterwards that counts! Courses differ a lot from one university to another so certain comparisons are hard to make.
Having both Durham and Cambridge on my CV has opened doors for me – I'm now an English Language lecturer at a good northern Italian University, Trento, which is I suppose the Durham of Italy! David H
I think in all fairness Durham is at least an equal, and the added historic significance of having a Castle and a CATHEDRAL (in which matriculation takes place, in gowns) is something that is sadly lacking in our institution.
Also, I have been informed that the average science degree in the fine institute known as Durham University requires the student to attend 3 supervisions per week (one more than our scientists, so realistically they have nothing to complain about).
Finally, the varsity link between us and 'the others', which arguably comes to a fruition with the varsity rugby match (bought out by the now high street brand of Jack Wills) and the boat race, are sadly undermined by both of the Oxbridge universities results againt the Northern version (both losing heavily for the past two years in both disciplines).
Overall, I believe that we should open are arms (and hearts) to our Northern brothers, and be proud to be the suffix of DOXBRIDGE! what?
""Also, I have been informed that the average science degree in the fine institute known as Durham University requires the student to attend 3 supervisions per week (one more than our scientists, so realistically they have nothing to complain about). ""
Cambridge NatScis have four supervisions a week in first year, three in second year and then one a week in third year so that you can spend more time in the lab.
Also, unless Durham NatScis go to Saturday lectures you can fuck off insinuating that Durham NatScis do more work. Just commenting.
How rude and somewhat stuck up. Yes Cambridge and Oxford are very good universities, but then so are Durham, Bristol, UCL and so on. Perhaps you should consider yourself privileged that you managed to gain a place at Oxbridge, but at the same time acknowledge that there are some exceedingly bright individuals at Durham and other top universities, including those that chose not to apply to Oxbridge (or dare I say it, turned down the odd place). People should be less complacent of where they are studying, and less eager to slate off others – let alone add to the conception that some Oxbridge students consider themselves elitist or better than others. For supposedly intelligent people, there are some very silly comments being made (e.g. it's too hilly to ride a bike there). Hopefully it is just a naive minority that hold such preconceived views. But Christonian
Fuck it.
Why don't we just call it KBEGYIDOxbirdge, after Kent, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, York, Imperial, Durham, Oxford and Cambridge. I suspect those Universities also fit the criteria that Taverner suggests. But why stop there? There's the University of Cape Town and who could forget the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen? History
Amazingly, no-one has mentioned the fact that the 'Oxbridge' moniker and the pairing of the two universities has absolutely nothing to do with their merits or similarities or some sort of rational modern decision, but simply because of their historical predating of other English universities as serious centres of higher learning. The term is relatively new – Thackeray coined it in 1849 – but even then Oxbridge's history granted them a reputation for being in an entirely different category to other universities. And the thought behind the name had existed as long as the two universities.
Thackeray also coined the other portmanteau 'Camford', but unfortunately it didn't catch on. Seems like that one had its priorities better sorted. alex
haha lol Peter
1. Doxbridge as a term was coined for the annual ""comedy match"" between the Oxford Revue, the Durham Revue and Footlights. It's a joke, not some conspiracy to pretend Durham is an ancient university. 2. Reanne MacKenzie is wrong on some facts about Durham –""There are no supervisions, no weekly essays, and no (frequent) all-nighters in the library."" Wrong on all three counts, though the supervisions are called tutorials as in Oxford. It didn't have a reading week in my day, but perhaps it does now, I don't know – no idea what the implied problem is anyway. 3. This article is so absurd (both halves of it) that I really hope no one takes it seriously in any way. The truth is that all three universities are excellent, and anyone should be proud to study at any of them. Durham was founded on the Oxford model and has more in common with Oxford and Cambridge than most other universities – both in the superficial matters (pretty old buildings, gowns, etc) and in academic rigour, teaching style, and research clout. It's also always highly ranked, sometimes as high as third. But it can't (and doesn't pretend to) match Oxford and Cambridge in some respects, including age and endowment. Sweaty Flaps
well there's only one thing i have to say about this
Floppy Ball-bag
I applied to Cambridge, Imperial, UCL, Harvard and Durham
Guess which one offered me a place without interview? Durham
Should have gone to Harvard… My two cents
It seems quite strange that some people seem so protective of their university that they have to start insulting other peoples', often in an extremely crude and non-analytical manner…
As for tutorials, contact hours etc. Yes, Durham does unfortunately lag behind, the main reason being the fact that it doesn't have the endowment, or the specific government subsidy for such a system. As a result, less money means less staff etc, and as a result unfortunately less contact hours. That being said, many departments do make up for it, and it seems quite strange that the response to departments like History and English consistently beating one or both of Oxbridge is ""well we're still better.""
Unfortunately, at least some of the stereotypes of Durham students are true. It is also true that there is a large subset of students who either didn't want to go to Oxbridge, or were unfortunate enough to simply do badly in their interview at the time. It seems quite unfair to lump all Durham students together as 'stupid,' especially when in many activities that I've seen which emphasise the intellectual (such as Debating), Durham is likely to beat Cambridge, and has consistently outperformed them all year.
Last, it is also quite telling that if one reads Charlie Taverner's piece, he concedes that academically most of Durham cannot compete, but merely illustrates that there are commonalities which justify the use of 'Doxbridge' as a description of a group of universities alongside the use of 'Oxbridge' to denote the specific academic superiority of those institutions. So perhaps everyone so eager to call Durham students stupid should notice that it wouldn't be too relevant to his points. Grammar police
*fewer contact hours. well…
It was nice to see that Durham University RFC crush the Cambridge Blues 44-22 on the weekend! just a thought
You do realize that after their respective varsity matches, Oxbridge sports teams piss it up? Derek Jackson
do you realise Durham are 31 games unbeaten #showmethemoneyjerry chaggers
Reanne you are a first year historian – if you have to do ""(frequent) all nighters in the library"" I suggest you might be suited to a less academically rigorous institution. One night in Reanne
Reanne, quite the snob since you started climbing the social ladder. A true rags to riches story; now you're qualified to comment about the rest of the university educations and students in the country. We salute you! Derek Jackson
Reanne you would blend into insignificance at Durham. You probably do at Cambridge, hence your controversial article seeking some attention. Your looks are mediocre, your intelligence is probably mediocre (using the undoubtable reputation of your institution as a platform to be vocal, readers assuming you are a fair reflection of Cambridge's academic excellence) and from speaking to you at a party in Cam your chat is like a 14 year old girl whose parents have always told her she's the best. But you probably don't remember me. You can't fight those genes Reanne. Cream Floats. LIP I am the 99%

The prestigious educational institution of Northumbria University (Formally Newcastle Polytechnic) has a 24hr Library, a boat race and varsity sports tournament with their nearest rivals (Newcastle) and formals (wearing a shirt on a night out counts doesn't it?). The students also regularly pull all nighters, which is due to the incredible work load and not because of a prevailing attitude of 'it'll be fine to just leave it till the last minute', that rumour was started by bitter arch-rivals Newcastle.
Therefore, owing to the similarities between Northumbria, Oxford and Cambridge I propose Noxbridge, to tie the true greatest university in with its slightly lesser brethren. Doxbridge
As someone who has been to all three I can honestly say that Durham was by far the best. Beautifully preserved and untouched by modernity and tourists. Oxbridge is so multinational and tourist ridden that it is a shadow of what it would have been in its heyday. why bother
This debate is completely pointless. Semantic babbling about if we should use the term ""Oxbridge"" or ""Doxbridge""…As it stands ""Doxbridge"" is not in common use and I can't see that changing in the near future. Academically isn't Bristol better than Durham anyway? Regardless the debate is totally unnecessary.
""The idea of amalgamating Durham, Cambridge, and Oxford into the ugly sounding “Doxbridge” makes me at first laugh, and then feel sick.""
So we're giving people a forum to express views like this? I feel SICK Mark
'Oxford and Cambridge have some departments which rank higher than Durham, although the vice versa is also true. But at the end of the day, they are all elite Universities'. Really? In world rankings the top universities in the U.K. are:- Cambridge comes in at #1, UCL #4, OXFORD #5, IMPERIAL #6, EDINBURGH #21, KINGS #26 BRISTOL #28, MANCHESTER #32, GLASGOW #54, WARWICK #58, SHEFFIELD #66, NOTTINGHAM #72, SOUTHAMPTON #73, BIRMINGHAM #77, AND ……DURHAM #92!! I would have loved to have gone to Oxbridge. Durham is a dump, miles from anywhere decent! For nightlife we have to go to Newcastle. Mark

In 2000 (yes over ten years ago now) I chose to apply to Durham and not bother with Oxford or Cambridge because although I had the grades I felt I wouldn’t make friends there – it was the arrogance and assumptions of superiority the other kids had – I chose Durham instead and had an amazing time and career since. I work in education still and am a passionate A level teacher but this debate makes me weep – nothing has changed, have an Oxbridge students heard of humility, modesty, gratitude! Durham is still brilliant but geographically isolated from Oxford and Cambridge which are in close proximity, that’s why they get lumped together! Durham should remain a bastion of difference and generally much nicer people. A state educated Geordie and eternally greatfull for the chance of a uni degree (wherever it came from) Lol
I’m sure we’re all very *grateful* for such insight.
PS I’m really not sure a 3 hour journey on the X5 is why Oxford and Cambridge are collectively known as Oxbridge. Argh
Why have people started commenting on this again, nearly two years later?? Now it pops up on Tab’s Most Commented and more and more people will comment without noticing the dates, pushing it even higher. Durham is not as good overall. The end. Now let it rest. Edinburgh

if you dont understand why you need a FF , then just get the 60D ,which is the best IQ APS-C sensored camera from Canon. I am now comparing the 60D, A55V , K5 , Kr and D7000. I just prefer the EOS60D , A55V files to others. I really dislike the Nikon D7000 colors are bad , noise is fairly low but odd NR in RAW effect in its NEF files........... The Pentax has a bit more detail and sharper image compared to the Nikon but a bit more noise. Over all though, the A55V has the best image quality in APS-C league. and it is very important to note no APS-C is still not even close to the 5D2 or A900 in terms of over all IQ , especially considering much better color depth and tonal transition of FFs. also if you just simply measure amount of noise at ISO1600 in good light the Pentax K5 , EOS60D and Nikon d7000 produce good low noise files and compete very well against the 5D2 but they cannot hold it together in real bad light where you really need high ISO. so what is the point of having high ISO which is good only under studio light? do not become a victim of marketing gimmick (APSC already matched a good ff at high ISO kind). Erik00 wrote: My first digital SLR was the 10D. I changed this to the 5D which I later changed to the 5D mk,II. I am an amateur - shooting sceneries, family events, portraits, street fotography, macro etc. I live in Thailand and travel frequently here and in neighbouring countries, where the climate is mostly very hot and humid. As I am not young any more I wanted a smaller camera for travel than my 5D II. I would not buy a pocket camera, because I really appreciate the image quality from the big sensors inSLR´s. I know from experience that if my fhotogear is too big and heavy, I am not bringing it with me on many occations. So I bought a Canon 550D for the smaller size, weight and the build-in flash, but I expected to se some drop in i.q. compared to my 5D II. After having owned the 550D 5 months I realized, that I almost never used my 5D II, because I did not se the expected drop in i.q. when using the 550D. (I have some very good/excellent lenses.) I deceided to make a small real-life test, In good light, afternoon sun, I shot the front of a town house at a distance of about 20 meters. The housefront has large windows with many signs and posters. I shot 10 photos in raw with each camera. On the 5D II I used my Canon 85mm f1.8. On the 550D I used my Canon 50mm 1.4 so the photos could have almost the same f.o.v. Both lenses were stopped down to f 5.6 and from all reviews I have read and from my own experiance the chosen lenses have almost same resolving power when stopped down to f 5.6. I converted the sharpest picture from each camera in DPP and did a little ajustments and sharpening in Photoshop Elements. Finally I printed the two photos at A3+ (13x19 inches). At this size I could se no difference in i.q. Even when I enlarged the photos to 100% in my computerscreen, I could only se a marginal difference. Both photos looked very sharp i.m.o. My reasons for believing, that it might be correct, that there is very little difference in i.q. in prints up to A3+ (at least up to ISO 1600/3200) in real life use are: 1. Both cameras have a very high resolution sensor and i.q. is more dependent of the quality of the lens than the difference in sensors. 2. The 550D has (according to the reviews in DPR) a wider dynamic range than the 5D II. (8,8 ctr. 8,4.) 3. The 550D can have an advantage in i.q. if used with a high quality FF lens compared to a similar lens used on the 5D II. F. inst. I have the Canon 24mm f1.4 II L lens. When I use this lens on my 550D I have a f.o.v. close to a 35mm lens mounted on a F.F. camera. From all the reviews I have seen the 24mm performs much better on the 550D than the Canon 35mm 1.4 L does on the 5D II until the lenses are stopped down to about f 2.8. I am mainly thinking of vignetting and corner sharpness. This effect should be the same with most F.F. lenses, as the cropped sensor only uses the "best part" of the lens. I really want to know if there is a - real life - significant difference in i.q. between the two cameras. If there is, I will keep my 5D II and try to lern judging i.q. better. I would appreciate very much, if I can get response from skilled photografers who own both cameras or at least have been using both cameras for a certan period. Thank´s on beforehand Erik

"Study Reveals Neuron-Firing Patterns that Underlie Time Measurement
Image: MIT News Oct 13, 2015 4 minutes read
Cambridge, MA (Scicasts) — Keeping track of time is critical for many tasks, such as playing the piano, swinging a tennis racket, or holding a conversation. Neuroscientists at MIT and Columbia University have now figured out how neurons in one part of the brain measure time intervals and accurately reproduce them.
The researchers found the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), which plays a role in sensorimotor function, represents elapsed time, as animals measure and then reproduce a time interval. They also demonstrated how the firing patterns of population of neurons in the LIP could coordinate sensory and motor aspects of timing.
LIP is likely just one node in a circuit that measures time, says Mehrdad Jazayeri, the lead author of a paper describing the work in the Oct. 8 issue of Current Biology.
“I would not conclude that the parietal cortex is the timer,” says Jazayeri, an assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. “What we are doing is discovering computational principles that explain how neurons’ firing rates evolve with time, and how that relates to the animals’ behaviour in single trials. We can explain mathematically what’s going on.”
The paper’s senior author is Michael Shadlen, a professor of neuroscience and member of the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. As time goes by
Jazayeri, who joined the MIT faculty in 2013, began studying timing in the brain several years ago while a postdoc at the University of Washington. He began by testing humans’ ability to measure and reproduce time using a task called “ready, set, go.” In this experiment, the subject measures the time between two flashes (“ready” and “set”) and then presses a button (“go”) at the appropriate time — that is, after the same amount of time that separated the “ready” and “set.”
From these studies, he discovered that people do not simply measure an interval and then reproduce it. Rather, after measuring an interval they combine that measurement, which is imprecise, with their prior knowledge of what the interval could have been. This prior knowledge, which builds up as they repeat the task many times, allows people to reproduce the interval more accurately.
“When people reproduce time, they don’t seem to use a timer,” Jazayeri says. “It’s an active act of probabilistic inference that goes on.”
To find out what happens in the brain during this process, Jazayeri recorded neuronal activity in the LIP of monkeys trained to perform the same task. In these recordings, he found distinctive patterns in the measurement phase (the interval between “ready” and “set”), and the production phase (the interval between “set” and “go”).
During the measurement phase, neuron activity increases, but not linearly. Instead, the slope of activity begins as a steep curve that gradually flattens out as time goes by, until the “set” signal is given. This is key because the slope at the end of the measurement interval predicts the slope of activity in the production phase.
When the interval is short, the slope during the second phase is steep. This allows the activity to increase quickly so that the animal can produce a short interval. When the interval is longer, the slope is gentler and it takes longer to reach the time of response.
“As time goes by during the measurement, the animal knows that the interval that it has to produce is longer and therefore requires a shallower slope,” Jazayeri says.
Using this data, the researchers could correctly predict, based on the slope at the end of the measurement phase, when the animal would produce the “go” signal.
“Previous research has shown that some neurons exhibit a ramping up of their firing rate that culminates with the onset of a timed motor response. This research is exciting because it provides the first hint as to what may control the slope of this ‘neural ramping,’ specifically that the slope of the ramp may be determined by the firing rate at the beginning of the timed interval,” says Dean Buonomano, a professor of behavioural neuroscience at the University of California at Los Angeles who was not involved in the research. “A highly distributed problem”
All cognitive and motor functions rely on time to some extent. While LIP represents time during interval reproduction, Jazayeri believes that tracking time occurs throughout brain circuits that connect subcortical structures such as the thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum to the cortex.
“Timing is going to be a highly distributed problem for the brain. There’s not going to be one place in the brain that does timing,” he says.
His lab is now pursuing several questions raised by this study. In one follow-up, the researchers are investigating how animals’ behaviour and brain activity change based on their expectations for how long the first interval will last.
In another experiment, they are training animals to reproduce an interval that they get to measure twice. Preliminary results suggest that during the second interval, the animals refine the measurement they took during the first interval, allowing them to perform better than when they make just one measurement.

"Firstly - much thanks for the replies in my earlier ""WD45 Jumping Out of Gear"" post. The answers to that question have turned me on to taking another look at an AC for my fleet.
The BIG issue for me is the potential for the tranny jumping out of gear when going down hill, with one of my teenagers in the seat and a load behind, like a baler or wagon of hay (partially loaded so as not to push the tractor). The veto of consideration for the WD45 was the jumping out of gear - and I now understand the design (helical cut gears) and operator abuse (grinding). Maybe the WD with straight cut gears/tranny is the path forward.
I am now of the impression that an early WD with the straight cut gears will NOT jump out of gear - period Is that a true statement? A WD with straight cut gears, by virture of it's design won't or can't jump out of gear? Or am I basically back to the same deal with the WD45?
Any difference in the brake set-up between the WD and WD45?
I've been reading a TON of posts/info and it sounds like many WD's got a conversion to a snap coupler set-up (an easy change?) and many times got a WD45 crank and pistons on a rebuild. Not to concerned with the hp differences between the WD and WD45 - but if I did a rebuild, would definitely consider going with a WD45 crank and pistons. I like the snap coupler set-up and would enjoy using it - just because....
If a WD got a WD45 crank/pistions - would there be any external indication of this or would you have to remove the head and simply measure from the top of the head to the top of the piston at full up stroke?
This is probably a stupid question, but
I've read the WD45 gas engine and it's governor was one sweet sounding tractor under load - especially running a square baler. How does the WD's sound differ? It is what it is - but just thought I'd ask...
So what I'm thinking now is a WD with straight cut gear tranny, wide front end. Adapt (if not already there) the snap coupler arrangement and if an engine rebuild comes - upgrading the crank and pistons to a WD45.
Aside from being a part time chore tractor (pulling a haybine, rake, tedder, an old NH 68 baler, hay wagon in addition to some wood hauling and bush hogging) - it's pretty much going to be a ""50's"" era tractor - just for kicks.
Looks like the WD's are less $$$'s than the WD45's too - OK with me.
In full disclosure - there is another ""50's"" era tractor that I'm studying up on and will likely find/buy/restore too and it's a Farmall 400 or 450 gas, but I just like the WD/WD45 design for the day it was made and if the straight cut gears solve the popping out of gear problem when going down hill - I'll probably buy one.
Any tips/advice is greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Bill"

LinkedIn We all know that visual is as much part of a brand’s presence as any words could ever be. From video to clever cartoons (aw, shucks), picture is a huge part of marketing (or at least they should be). Enter Instagram, the photo sharing social network that all the cool kids use. From that Austrailian model who finally “got real” to the guy who got jiggy with his cat, Instagram is a haven for creatives. It’s also useful for small but mighty agencies in the Midwest to showcase their awesome culture. Cody and Cate have both been tasked with Instagram duty on the daily. But it’s not so simple when you can’t get your coworkers to pose! Here are some Instagram best tips , whether you’re using it for marketing or…this. Use faces. People like it 38% more. (Cate, I’m ready for my closeup!) 20% of the internet uses Instagram, that is a lot. On average, posts by top brands receive 216 comments, with 50% of comments being posted in the first six hours and 75% posted in the first 48 hours. According to SimplyMeasured, @mentions in captions receive 56% more engagement!! (Cody, tag your teammates!!) Adding a location results in 79% higher engagement (hell , we have the coolest office ever!) Trying to make your ideas come to life on the screen? While our cartoons can help get your spirits up, we work a lot better when you make Red Branch Media part of the team.
"v3nom151 said: ↑ As far as analytical testing goes, are they testing the liquid in a vaporized form out of an atomizer? Or just measuring the compounds in the liquid itself? I believe that most laboratories simply measures the 3 diketone compounds that are found in some e-liquid.
In a restaurant environment, NSF certified tables and instruments are made of at least 316 stainless steel. This type of stainless resists corrosion from various acidic foods quite well. The corrosion resistance is whats key, and why it is chosen for commercial use. The same goes for selecting a corrosion resistant material to machine an atomizer from.
I can't tell you what metal clone atomizers are made of, but if its not top quality, I personally wouldn't vape out of it. Ph balance of liquid and the type of materials that are used in atomizers are both important regardless of who's trying to regulate it. They may use this information when selecting what devices can and cannot be used once these regulations are introduced. Click to expand... You obviously have just enough knowledge to be dangerous. It's painfully apparent you have done no research for yourself and are believing whatever your being told is the results. No acidic foods have ever eroded metals. They can leach chemicals from certain plastics but not hurt metals other than some discoloration. If this was true caned foods like lemon juice and pineapple juice wouldn't work as they would eat through the cans. Those are the most acidic fruits around. Pure citric acid is used as a food grade cleaner because it doesn't harm metal surfaces like hydrogen based acids can.
Go to the health subsection, CASAA website or dr Farsalinos blog and read up on the studies done. The full text of those studies is available. This thread is not the place to discuss the ins and outs of the studies that is a whole other thread and those already exist."

"according to their size guide, I should ride a 54cm, which has a 575mm ETT. considering every other drop bar bike I have ridden comfortably has a 540-560mm ETT, that sounds insane! I would have to put a 30mm stem on it for the reach to work, if anything else about this geometry is conventional. I ride a 52cm Some DCD, and to get the same ETT as the 52cm Whyte, I would be riding a 56cm Soma. my neck is getting sore just thinking about that.
I admit I have not been able to wrap my head around stack & reach as opposed to simply measuring ETT, but that still sounds nuts. why are their bikes so friggin long?
edit- just read that explanation about the longer wheel base and shorter stem, so I guess that makes sense. still, I don't see how an extra 2"" in ETT can be taken up with a shorter stem unless you are using a downhill stubby stem. I have a 90mm stem on my bike, so I would have to use a teeny tiny stem on that."
"Water-Saving Agricultural System Wins Best Product
The 2015 Hackaday Prize included something new: a prize for the Best Product. The winner took home $100k in funding, a six-month residency at the Supplyframe Design Lab in Pasadena, and help turning a budding product into a full-grown success. And the winner is… Vinduino
Water is a crucial element for farming: the plants need enough, but not too much. Water is also an increasingly precious resource all over the world. In California, five times as much water is used in agriculture as is used by residential consumers. A 25% reduction in agricultural use, for instance, would entirely offset all urban water use. With this in mind, a number of California farmers are trying to voluntarily reduce their water consumption. But how?
One important development is targeted irrigation. Getting precisely the right amount of water to each plant can reduce the fraction lost to evaporation or runoff. It’s a small thing, but it’s a very big deal.
Cue Vinduino , a long-running project of “gentleman farmer” and hacker [Reinier van der Lee]. As a system, Vinduino aims to make it easy and relatively inexpensive to measure the amount of water in the soil at different depths, to log this information, and to eventually tailor the farm’s water usage to the plants and their environment. We were able to catch up with [Reinier] at the Hackaday SuperConference the day after results were announced. He shared his story of developing Vinduino and recounts how he felt when it was named Best Product:
The product that won Best Product is simple, but very well executed. It’s a hand-held soil moisture sensor reader that couples with a DIY soil probe design to create a versatile and inexpensive system. All of the 2015 Best Product Finalists were exceptional. Vinduino’s attention to detail, room for expansion, and the potential to help the world pushed this project over the top. The System
The basic, handheld Vinduino is a calibrated AC resistance meter. An Arduino inside the rugged enclosure sends current first this way, then that, through the moisture sensors and measures the voltage drop across some known resistors. At least half of the development work, however, was focused on the in-ground humidity sensors.
As dirt gets wet, it conducts more easily. You could, in principle, simply measure this resistance. But different soil compositions make calibration difficult, and corrosion of the probes is equally a problem. Finally, the terminals of the probes themselves can create a battery when placed in the soil, vastly complicating the calibration problem by imposing a voltage across the resistance that you’d like to measure. [Reinier] spent a lot of time getting his DIY gypsum water sensors accurately calibrated , standardized, and compensated for “concentration cell” battery effect. His great documentation of the process makes it replicable on a shoestring budget. Making the sensors robust and cheap is important, because the next step is to drive three (or more) of the sensors into the plants’ root zone at varying heights.
Driving multiple sensors into the ground allows the farmer to target his plants exact water needs. Measuring how wet the soil is at the surface, in the root zone, and then just below the roots makes it possible to figure out the net water flow, and water the roots only when they get dry, not when the ground on top of the roots is dry.
The handheld unit connects up to these water sensors and makes measuring the soil moisture at these different levels as easy as walking around the vineyard with a log-book. And because the handheld unit’s firmware is open source, nothing stops the farmer from using different soil humidity sensors that require different calibration curves, or from using the same setup to measure soil salinity.
But [Reinier] has a whole system in mind, and it’s one that doesn’t involve walking around the fields taking measurements. He’s already built up prototypes of a networked, permanent version of the handheld unit that can stay in the field and record continuous moisture data. The next steps are fully-automatic watering control, by combining the control of irrigation valves and water pressure dataloggers .
Optimal, minimal water use in agriculture is an idea that can help save water on a large scale. By making the measurements easy and cheap, Vinduino helps farmers take the first step. By making it all open source, modular, and accessible, much more likely to have an impact. So far, [Reinier] estimates that he’s cut his water consumption down by 25%, and by further developing his system, he’s making it possible for others. Good luck with Vinduino and congratulations!

"So this beautiful shelving piece goes for just under $400. However if you're handy with a hammer(or rather screwdriver) you can build this yourself. You can buy an old frame at a thrift store and some cheap lumber at a home improvement store. Simply measure the wood to fit the frame and get your carpenter on. Paint the whole thing whatever color you wish and add sturdy hangers to the back. Definitely a beautiful diy gothic decor piece.

"Originally Posted by federernadal Alright I have some follow up questions.
How do we relate the outside temp to the condenser temp? I used to think they are the same, but clearly they are not (different systems require different charge due to this reason right?). Now that you realize the ambient and condensing temperatures are different, you now need to know why they are different. Basically, it is all about heat transfer...ie, heat travels from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. Since condenser is intended to transfer heat from the refrigerant gas to air (or water), there must be a temperature difference between the refrigerant and air. For a given condenser, the greater the temperature difference, the greater it's heat transfer capacity will be. The evaporator works in a similar fashion, but it is absorbing heat and so its refrigerant also requires a temperature difference to the air to transfer heat.
Once again I need to say that you cannot use a p/h diagram to calculate the charge, only the mass flow rate. Your additional questions regarding changes in charge appear to me to be confused with changes in mass flow rates. Am I correct?
Have you done any calculations yet for mass flow rates? If so, vary the conditions for the condensing and evaporator temperatures. See how the rates change. Do some further calculations including the compressor and the theoretical compressor horsepower required. Discover how changing conditions changes the power requirements.
If for some reason you truly need to calculate a charge, there are a lot to learn before you can attempt that. I have never done a complete calculation of the operating charge required for a condenser or an evaporator. All of that can be obtained from the manufacturer...and chances re they didn't actually calculate it either, because they tend to simply measure and estimate things that are too difficult to calculate accurately."

This year I know I wanted to make at least ONE of my holiday gifts… so I made this turquoise apron using our draft-it-yourself Apron pattern and it turned out fabulous, fun, and feminine (my favorite f word). There is something so rewarding in giving your loved ones handmade gifts that are unique and one-of-a-kind, and best of all made with love! Read more for my full sewing tutorial on making this DIY apron (p.s. it only took me 3 hours from start to finish, including wrapping).
Above is our Apron pattern that I used, and it is a draft-it-yourself pattern that I actually drafted right on my fabric! So it was nice, quick, and easy.
I picked up matching turquoise and white floral cotton fabrics as well as gold wide trim to make this apron out of. I made the largest size of this pattern and I used 1 yd of each cotton, and 3 yds of trim.
To keep things organized and so I didn’t mix up the pieces, after I cut out each piece I labeled it with a sticky note the pattern letter and name. I didn’t take it off until I was ready to sew it! Prepping the fabric and pieces was a breeze, since all the piece were rectangle, so I simply measured on the fabric and ripped the pieces out.
There were only two pieces to interface… The waistband apron pieces, so I cut them out of interfacing and fused to the fabric. I forgot to get interfacing at the fabric store, so I had to use my scrap black interfacing instead (good thing it wasn’t noticeable in the end).
I started sewing the bottom large apron piece and the first thing to do was to press in the side and lower edges and stitch in place. Then I marked the placement of the pocket pieces on the apron piece and finished the top edges of the pocket pieces with trim!
Once the trim was on I pressed the pocket side and lower edges to the wrong side and placed on the apron piece along the markings and topstitched in place.
Next I went to the top bib apron piece and finished the top edge in the same way I did for the pockets. I pressed down the top allowance edge and topstitched the trim in place from the right side making sure I caught the allowance edge from the wrong side. I also serged the side edges and pressed to the wrong side and topstitched to finish. I notched the center front both on the bib piece and the waistband pieces. Then I matched up the notches and laid the bib piece face down to one of the waistband pieces and basted in place.
Now was to prepare the tie pieces/sash pieces and baste in place on the same waistband piece. To finish off the sash I serged the bottom and side edges and pressed to the wrong side, I then topstitched from the right side. On the side edges of the waistband I marked the 1/2"" seam allowance from the top and bottom and pinned the sash pieces in between the markings creating a pleat.
Once everything was basted in place on the waistband (the bib and two sashes) I placed and pinned the other waistband piece over the other and stitch around the top and side edges, leaving the bottom open. I clipped the corners and turned out right out. Then I gave it a nice press and pointed my corners.
Now was time to revisit that apron skirt piece! I had to gather it all in to fit the waistband piece, so I sewed a long basting stitch along the top edge and gathered in making sure to match up the center fronts. I sewed to the lower edge of the waistband and serged all the allowances together and pressed upwards towards the waistband.
To add some extra gold, I topstitched the trim along the center of the waistband starting and stopping at each sash.
Lastly it was time to sew the straps! I press the allowances to the wrong side and then pressed in half. I topstitch around the edges and added some more gold trim to the center of the pieces. More gold the better!
I then placed the finished strap pieces to the upper side corners of the bib piece and stitched in place along the same stitching line as the trim. I also wrapped the gold trim around the end of the strap.
So my apron is pretty much finished! I decided to make the sash ends looks a little more pleasant and press in the corners to the wrong side. To secure in place I used some hand stitches.
Ta da! Here it is, my finished apron. I am so excited to give it away! It was super fun to make and I love how all the colors work together (they are the colors of her kitchen).
Still thinking about making a holiday gift? Well you still have time, and this apron is super cute and easy to sew.
Happy Sewing!"

"Report: Brand Activity, Engagement Growing on Instagram Posted on 09 December 2015
Advertising on Instagram has become an effective and profitable strategy. Social media users are heavily engaged with brands, and brands are learning that Instagram is no longer an option, but a necessity.
A report from Simply Measured examines how brands are adopting Instagram, and shows just how much engagement they’ve achieved.
Simply Measured analyzed more than 2,500 posts and 80 million likes and comments from more than 138 followers of 90 brands in the Interbrand 100 during November of this year.
Across all metrics, participation and engagement is up. They found that 90 percent of the included brands now have accounts on the site, compared to nearly 50 percent in 2012. Approximately 80 percent of accounts are active on a weekly basis, and have more than 10,000 followers. A third of companies even post 10-20 times a month, and the number of brands posting more than 50 times a month have doubled over the last three years.
This increased activity has been answered with an increase in engagement. Likes and comments have increased 53 percent year-over-year, with the average brand among the Interbrand 100 receiving more than 30,000 interactions per post. Posts with hashtags and locations tags, and posts with multiple hashtags perform better compared to posts with none, or too many.
Brands across multiple verticals seem to be able to hold massive attention on Instagram, often despite a shortage of posts. During the survey period Nike had no recorded posts, yet the brand maintains 29.8 million followers — the highest number of any brand on the list. Several luxury brands also held spots in the top 10 for followers and the top 10 for engagement, which is a longstanding trend of strong brand performance on Instagram .

Consider a owner-operated wheel alignment shop that uses mechanical gauges and strings to do alignments vs a chain that uses a computerized laser alignment machine. Which would you prefer? Some people don't even know that alignments can be done without a computerized machine. My feeling is that if I wanted the alignment simply measured, the computerized machine operated by employees of unknown experience might give a better report. However if I want the alignment adjusted, I suspect would be better off with that owner-operated small shop that uses gauges and strings. Opinions?

Thursday, 10 December 2015 Boost Your Business With Marketing Tips Old And New With marketing methods that are constantly changing, it can be tough keeping up. But it can also be easy to get caught up in all the trends and forget about some of the tried-and-true methods that still really work. In this week’s Small Business Trends Community News and Information Roundup, members of the online small business community share both. You’ll find old tried-and-true techniques that have never gone out of style and newer tips that will help put your business ahead. Read on for the full list. Get Your Customers Talking with Referrals and Word of Mouth (Grasshopper) Word of mouth marketing can still be one of the most effective techniques out there. Many consumers are just more likely to believe and act on messages from other consumers, rather than those that come right from businesses. Kaleigh Moore shares some ways your business can get customers talking and gain referrals. Don’t Forget About Direct Mail (Lob) When you think about new marketing trends, direct mail is probably not one of the first things that comes to mind. But offline techniques like this one can still be effective with the right market and the right strategy. Adelyn Zhou discusses some of the benefits and features of effective direct mail marketing. Create Content That Search Engines Fall Over Themselves to Rank (Content Champion) With so many different SEO strategies out there, it can be easy to forget one of the oldest (and most effective ones): creating good content. Loz James shares some strategies for creating content that is both quality and likely to improve your SEO. The BizSugar community also weighed in on the topic. Create Offers to Increase Online Conversion Rates (Riverbed Marketing) The channels that businesses use to reach customers are constantly changing. But the ideas behind them are much more stable. You need to find out what customers want and create offers that will get them interested. Todd Mumford discusses how creating offers online can increase your conversion rates. Use Psychology to Improve Checkout Page Conversions (Neil Patel) No matter what methods of marketing you use, you always have to think like a customer. Consider what part of the process might make them feel a certain way and how that could impact their buying behavior. When it comes to online shopping, there are plenty of thoughts and emotions that could impact whether customers actually complete their purchases. So, you can actually use psychology to improve checkout page conversions, according to Neil Patel. Identify Targets for Search Engine Marketing (Don’t Panic Mgmt) Your search engine marketing, along with any other marketing efforts, won’t work unless you have a clearly identified target audience. For some tips on how to best identify targets for your search engine marketing strategy, according to Andrew Hanson. Use Google Analytics to Measure Engagement on Your Blog (RazorSocial) You’re likely already aware of the power of Google Analytics. But simply measuring your pageviews and referrers isn’t always enough. Just as with any type of business or marketing method, you need to be able to measure engagement. Ian Cleary shares some tips for measuring engagement using Google Analytics. BizSugar members also shared thoughts on the post. Activate Data to Engage the Right Individual (Marketing Land) The types of data that businesses have access to when it comes to their target audiences has increased greatly in recent years. But what hasn’t changed is the need to reach customers on an individual level. Luckily, you can actually use data to better engage with individual customers, per Jeff Hirsch. Boost SEO by Commenting on Blogs (Allin1Social) Much fuss has been made about the death of the blog. And it’s true that some of the community aspects of blogging have fallen by the wayside in recent years as different social platforms have stepped in. But commenting on blogs in your niche can still be a viable strategy for improving your own blog’s SEO if done correctly. Cristina Hontanilla discusses acceptable methods for doing so. Keep Up with Technology Trends (The Franchise King) The one constant with technology is that it’s always changing. Your business, no matter the industry or target audience, needs some kind of technology to function. You have to keep up with at least the most prevalent tech trends, some of which are included in an infographic and discussed by Joel Libava.

Having used my dad's old T70 SLR for the last few years, my experience with autofocus systems has been limited to the point and shoot type I owned many years ago. My first P&S camera was a Pentax with 3 (count 'em 3) focus positions for the lens. Pretty impressive for 1984! Ten years after that, I picked up a Nikon Zoomtouch with a continuous autofocus. The thing is, that 10 year old Nikon can set the focus very quickly (got to be less than 1/4 second). Looking at the camera, there are two windows on the front used for the infrared focusing system, which I assume simply measures the distance from the camera to the object between the focus brackets in the viewfinder. Works well in low light since it is infrared based. Its fast since it can quickly step the focus motor to the correct position to focus at the measured distance. Well, my A60 focuses like my grandmother (well, probably like me too). I swear that it just slowly steps the focus motor along and attempts to figure out the focus by actually looking at the scene. That is, it slowly examines the scene while moving the lens looking for the point where the image gets the least blurry, and then backs the focus to that position. In fact, the farther away the current focus point is from the focus point of the last shot the longer it takes! Is this the system that is actually being used? This would explain the focus assist lamp. It has to light up the scene in order to see anything to look for that lack of blurriness. But is this really better than the infrared focusing used in my older cameras? So far, the infrared focusing is faster and works in complete darkness. So why isn't that system used? What has happened that makes the current focus systems preferrable than the infrared system? Thanks!

Has anyone found a tool or method (on Windows) for simply measuring the i/o throughput by physical drive? Obviously, it's quite easy to shift swap, temp, application-specific cache directories between drives and hence balance the i/o between multiple spindles? I'm considering ripping out my existing disks and starting again with: A pair of 200GB 10,000 RPM type internal drives (e.g. WD Raptor's) for system, swap, temp, cache etc. A 1TB SATA internal for data. A 1TB SATA/USB-2 external for backup.

You can't quantify how much of which it is doing. The best test overall is simply measuring compression in all cylinders using the same equipment, same procedure and same conditions for pre and post tests. Regards, Rich

Sunday, November 8, 2015 Ancient/Mediaeval war Games: Playtesting Paul Little's rule set. Byzantine vs Bulgars. Bulgars (on the right) seize the initiativeand advance rapidly into action. Lately I have been trying out Paul Liddle's simple rules for Ancient/Mediaeval battles. Not having seen action for a long, long time, my Byzantines and Bulgars were keen to 'have at it'. I thought I'd make it a fairly sizeable action. In the photos to come you will observe that some of my Bulgars are lacking in 'finish'. My apologies for that. Scene from behind the Byzantines, facing southwest. The armies were; Commanders Tsar Attila, Boili Atalik and Boili Attaboi: 3 units heavy horse archers 4 units light horse archers4 units spear heavy infantry2 units archer medium infantry1 unit javelin light infantry14 units total; Byzantine objective: destroy at least 7. Bulgar horse on their right flank. Byzantine (c.1000AD) Commanders: Emperor Dementius, George Maniakes, Dimetrios Psychopathes. 1 unit lance/bow kataphraktoi (elite Cataphracts)2 units lance/bow Tagmatic kavallarioi (Heavy Cavalry)2 units lance/bow Thematic kavallarioi (Medium Cavalry)1 unit lance/bow prokoursatores (Light Cavalry)1 unit Varangians (elite spear Heavy Infantry)3 units skutato i (spear/bow Heavy Infantry)1 unit peltastoi (spear Medium Infantry)1 unit sphendonistai (slinger Light Infantry)12 units total; Bulgar objective: destroy at least 6. Byzantine centre and left. The Varangians and peltastoi have been kept in reserve. The observant reader will see that most of the units on both sides are armed with bows. The only other missiles are the slings and javelins of the respective light infantry. The Byzantines had two and the Bulgars four units not so armed, all of them foot. Looking down the Byzantineline from left to right(south to north) Action: Without going into a lengthy narrative, the action went like this. The Bulgars seized the early initiative ( i.e. won the die roll to see who moved first ), and scored some damaging hits on the Byzantine horse on the left flank, including on the cataphracts. The exchange of horse archery has disordered both sides... As the picture below indicates, the Bulgar advance was somewhat impetuous, but I was figuring to get in a few blows with the faster moving archers, so that the spears could eventually close against some damaged opposition. Bulgars hurrying into action hoping to get in the first strikes. The village of Marsople anchored the Byzantine right flank. The slingers advanced through it, whilst a medium cavalry unit passed by on the north side (i.e. to the left of it from the Bulgar (camera) point of view). Slingers have seized the village, which will serveto anchor the Byzantine right flank. The pictures below show that as the horse closed on the southern flank, the Byzantines had already taken some damage. The Emperor probably should have stayed with the cataphracts, for they succumbed fairly soon. Neither side seems able to rally their wavering units (I think the Bulgars had one and the Byzantines no successful rallying rolls all day). Worse for the Byzantines was that their flanking Prokoursatores were being enveloped by the enemy light horse. The Byzantine cavalry are getting the worse of theirscrap with their Bulgar counterparts. The nearest Bulgarunit seems to have recovered its morale, beforeAttaboi moved to help against the cataphracts. On the other hand, in the centre, although the plan was for the Bulgar bowmen to inflict some damage before the 'push of pike', they were getting decidedly the worst of it. General view. The Byzantine foot have outshot theBulgar archers, and the Tagmatic horse damagedone of the spear units as well. Not looking so good for the Bulgars in the centre, then. As the battle seemed to be shaping, so it continued. Once the cataphracts disappeared, the Byzantine left flank horse gradually crumbled away, and only the intervention of the Varangian spearmen from the reserve line kept up a semblance of a line in that sector. In the centre, though, it was the Byzantines who gained the upper hand, and in favour of whom the balance tilted more and more until the Bulgarian foot collapsed So close was the fighting overall, that the issue remained in doubt until the very end, when the destruction of two units in one turn decided the battle in Byzantine favour: 8 Bulgar units destroyed for 5 Byzantine. Now you see 'em... Comment: ...now you don't: the cataphracts overwhelmed... One of the things I had to get used to was the 'conkers' IGoUGo system. I have run across it before in some of the Games Workshop's games (specifically, Space Crusade ) . Such a system takes a little getting used to, especially in the type of open ended war games such as this. The system favours aggression, that's for sure: get stuck in, and get in your first licks. That's the caper. ...followed by a Bulgar heavy and a light horse unit, the latterdespite the flank attack striking into the prokoursatores' flank. Let me illustrate by oversimplifying a bit. Forget about the 'wavering' rule for a minute, and imagine that a hit immediately eliminated the enemy. Imagine, too, two equally matched units, RED and BLUE, facing off. Byzantines close in for melee action. There was probably no realto do this, as distant shooting seems equally effective. For no better reason than I mentioned it first, RED moves into close combat and strikes the first blow. It has to roll 9 with 2D6 - a 28% chance of immediate victory. But if it misses, then BLUE will get to strike in his turn, with the same probability. So it will continue until one or the other is eliminated, or something terminates the action. General view. Byzantine left flank crumbling -not looking too good! Now, let us go back to the beginning: who has the advantage? Obviously it is RED, who gets the first strike, and if necessary, the third, fifth and so on. Blue gets the right of reply only if he survives each time. Given a fight to the finish, the probability that RED will win works out at a whisker over 58% (odds of 29:21 in RED's favour). That is a significant margin. This imbalance does not necessarily invalidate the combat system. Rather it encourages aggression for one thing, places a premium on missilery for another, and, I suspect, might also place a premium on tactical manoeuvre. That last will have to be tried. Prokoursatores struck, front and flank. A couple of points might be worth looking into. 1. Breaking off. There are no rules that might allow a faster moving opponent to break off a close action. Whether this is desirable I'm not sure, but during the course if this, and a subsequent, battle, it occurred to me that lighter troops that get themselves into trouble might want to try a break clear. The jury is still out on this one. General melee in the Bulgar right-centre. Whilst engaged toits front with heavy Byzantine horse, Tsar Atila's horse has beenhit in the flank by a unit of skutatoi led by George Maniakes.To the rescue comes Attaboi's horse, striking the skutatoi inthe flank. 2. Retrograde moves. This goes to evades and, if it is deemed a good idea, breaking off moves. Now, units are permitted a 'free' turning/pivot/swivel move at the end of their standard move. Evading units probably ought to be allowed this turn at the beginning of their move, ending their evasive move facing away from the danger being evaded. In fact, light troops should probably be allowed to make this pivot at any time during their move. The impact on the mobility of light troops would make them formidable opponents. I am wondering what their facing should be at the end of the evade move: towards the enemy, or in the direction of movement. I assumed the latter, which went rather badly for a couple of Bulgar light horse units in a second battle (of which, more in another posting). One evaded at a crawl, and the Byzantines had enough movement remaining promptly to catch them, hack their rear, and ride them down. The other ended up being chivvied and chased to the table edge, and was also eventually caught and eliminated. Having survived the flank attack, in its turn the skutatoi turn to face Ataboi's cavalry. Peltastoi about to intervene in the indecisive action onthe Bulgar right. 3. Missilery vs Melee. During this action, I allowed bow armed units to close to hand to hand without really considering the desirability to do so. Byzantine skutatoi don't really need to close: their best tactic is to stand off and let the non-bow-armed enemy come to them. Where it got tricky was with bow armed horse on both sides. I could equally well have had one or both sides stand off and shoot it out. The question is whether there ought to be some differential in the effect of shooting and melee. One possibility that crosses my mind is that instead of destroying a 'wavering' mounted unit, a second 'waver' result from shooting causes it to flee, if it can. This 'fleeing move' might be adjudicated in the same way as an evade move. Kavallarioi charge Bulgar light horse, whilst the light infantry stand off.I forgot the Bulgar ' psiloi were javelin armed, to thatthe slingers should not be carrying a 'waver' marker. 4. Ordinary movement. One thing I didn't really pick up on was just how flexible, or proscribed, the system of movement is supposed to be. I tended to allow wheels and whatnot, simply measuring the outside of the wheel. It did occur to me that the author intended that all movement be in the direction faced, with a pivot at the end, if desired. Your comments, Paul? Bulgar centre begins to crumble... 5. Turning to face. In a few instances, melees developed into a kind of 'staircase' arrangement when successive flank attacks and counter-attacks failed to achieve a decisive result. I assumed that in such circumstances, a unit, in its own turn, could - possibly should - abandon its flank attack, and face the enemy to its own flank. If so, ought this move be optional or mandatory? ... whilst the Bulgar light horse begin to envelop the Byzantine left.I could have handled this a lot better, with the horsearchers fetching a much deeper sweep into the Byzantine rear. I also assumed that in the even of a frontal attack combined with a flank attack, both attacks were adjudicated separately, which seemed to me reasonable. Two bites of the cherry. The chances of scoring at least one 'waver' result in such circumstances is about 70%, and there is about a 16% chance of wiping out the target unit in one go. Oddly enough, both sides proved on the day to be a lot more resilient than these probabilities would indicate. Bulgar reserve spearmen enter the fray. Bulgar javelinmen in trouble - left in the lurch be evadinghorse archers... Bulgar centre showing signs of cracking. Byzantine left has practically vanished, with the Varangiansholding the place formerly held by four horsed units. Varangians see off Bulgar heavy horse, just as theyare hit in flank by the lights. One Bulgar unit stands ready for a rear attack. Thinks looking bleak for the Bulgar spearmen. Peltastoi victorious! Spear unit destroyed before the flank attack can come in... Bulgar javelinmen shrug off attack from front and flank... End of the action. Bulgar centre collapses altogether, beforethe same could happen to the Byzantine left. Close call for the Byzantines, who win, 8-5. That was my first play test, and it has to be said, the thing went with a swing. Posted by

If you dont know, the I-cade was a little ""arcade cabinet"" sold in toy stores and such. It was just a cabinet, with a bluetooth control panel, and room for you to put an ipad in, and play games with the button. For time purposes, and uniformity as well, the icade was a good idea, as its a perfect size, and for between 20-40 dollars each, were both content with that decision. Yes i could probably make 10 out of one 30 dollar piece of wood.. but then edge/t molding/ finishing, assembling, priming for art, plus the other tons of stupid little mishaps, im just happy with him dropping off a pre-made box for me to transform. Im working on a few, but this is the first fully finished one. I will try to do a detailed write up of my project. I learned alot of small lessons that will help me make these a lot faster. I would like to thank another buddy of mine who schooled me on electric work and made the product very clean.. also lucian, He did a bang up job, as per usual, on the art, and even went the length to fix some mistakes that I had made and was really cool about it. So here we go..
The machines internal power was done very nicely with help,and features a single power port that gets plugged into and powers the whole machine. It plugs in, turns on and boots directly to Robotron!
SPECS/PARTS
Icade cabinet
Raspberry pi 2b running mame4all
RPi gpio board
10"" lcd screen
1.5' hdmi cable
""boomboxx"" bootleg portable speakers (from five below.. cost 3 bucks each and they sound GREAT.. even too loud when turned up.
2 zippyy joysticks
led light strip for marquee lighting
lexan for the marquee and bezel pieces
12v-5v voltage regulator, for splitting out various voltages to different things
various nuts, screws, terminals, plugs, inserts, and fun stuff..
And heres the build process. Again, there were some learning processes, ESPECIALLY the software. Ive never touched linux or anything like a PI. But as long as you have a goal and learn towards it, you get there. I started with the icade itself. My first problem off the bat was, the icade has a plastic control panel, with a joy, and 8 buttons. That had to go, so i removed the top part of the control panel with the buttons and guts. That left me with the bottom half of the panel, which has the half rounded lip. This would pose a problem with adding my own control panel, as far as wrapping the art around, and it looking seamless. So i basically hacked the hell out of the icade plastic, and just left a flush frame running clean with the wood frame. The thing is with these, my relationship with my friend as far as projects go, isnt exactly cash for labor.. i hook him up, and hes always done things for me when i need help. So if i was either getting paid handsomely, OR building to perfection, id gut all the plastic and build a curved cp that curves down into the front bottom face. So anyways, what you see, is my final idea for the direction of the cp.

Next was figuring out how and where to fit all the internal parts. And after alot of trying to stuff it under the control panel.. i realized i can fit most of it right on the back piece of the cabinet, behind the monitor!

For the control panel, i used 1/4"" fiberboard type material. Very smooth and clean, easy to work with. I basically just traced and cut the shape of the frame i left after butchering the plastic panel out. I also routed a slot out at the top for the bottom of the bezel to sit into. I then began measuring for placement and art and such
adult image host
The marquee was basically straightforward..The icade comes with a top part of the marquee that opened and closed to slide the ipad in. I just needed the bottom piece of the marquee, so i simply measure side to side.. give it about 3""depth just enough to cover what would be in front of the bezel. I routed small slots across the marquee pieces to fit the actual marquee and hold it in. I also cut two holes in for speakers, to keep it authentic. Now here i ran into a problem.. How to install the speakers. I made the initial mistake of cutting first, thinking after and cut the two holes.. so i was left to figure out a way to make a nice speaker grill... So i used my trusty dremel, and cut out the actual round pieces from the speaker i bought. I found these 3 dollar speakers at five below, and they sound AWESOME. I Bought 5 different speakers they had and tested them all. This sounded the best. So i went back and bought a bunch. They come with aux cord, and run off 2 aaa batteries, so i knew i could easily internally power them. On the next one i build im going to drill a pattern through the bottom marquee piece instead of a grill on the outside. But i think this came out ok. I cut out the round frames and grills, and spray painted them black.

Next was the power situation to tie it all together. I wanted a very nice set up.. no power cords hanging out, no power strips.. luckily i had a good friend who just completely schooled me completely. My problem was this, all of the internal components ran on different voltages..
Monitor-12v
pi-5 v
led strip-12v
speakers-3v
I wanted to have one single female port on the back, that you would plug power into, super clean and proper. I installed everything inside, and then wired it up as following. I used a 4 terminal power strip. In coming into it was the female port that would be in the back. That would bring 12v into the machine. I ran a ground and hot line to each side
pic host
I went to a electronics mecca place that i didnt know existed which had EVERYTHING in the universe you could need.. They hooked me up with several power plug pigtails, voltage regulators, and proper 12v 2.0A transformers. I soldered a plug on the end of the transformer from the wall plug, that would plug into the back of the cabinet in the little port that runs into the inside
photos upload
back on the inside, that 4 terminal strip, still have the 12v and ground hooked up. I connect a 12v to 5 volt regulator right onto the strip.. 12v goes to the same 12v incoming.. and the 5v goes on one side of the empty terminal, now making the other side of that same terminal 5 volt powered. I run power from that 5v terminal and a ground to the pi, and boom! I have 5v running to the pi from a 12v line. I also just jumped a line from the 12v terminal to the led power strip as well. The speakers ran off of 3 volts, so i just hooked them up to the Raspberry pi 3v pins, and they work beautifully.
hosting image
The joysticks and buttons were all wired as normal, and run into a gpio board, which essentially is the same idea as an ipac or any encoder. Ill save the technical crap and leave it at that. BUT i do need to shout out RETROGAME by adafruit.. its a fully set up to boot and program the gpio board.. basically the ""winipac"" software of the pi. Helped me out alot. I also found some nice simply wire harness that worked great for the setup! Perfect length. I just clip one end off, and then i have a 14 pin connector with open ends to solder/crimp onto controls
image upload
I dont have specific pictures but throughout the above pictures you can see i also made to little slots on each side of the cabinet inside, to hold the horizontal lcd monitor in.
*** IN SOME PICS, THE SCREEN IS VERTICAL.. THIS IS INITIALLY HOW I PUT IT IN, AND REALIZED I CAN GET A LOT MORE SCREEN IF I JUST ROUTE OUT A LITTLE SLOT TO MAKE THE LCD FIT**
free screen capture
The last bit would be the artwork, and of course, again, thanks to mr bowman for rocking the artwork gig.
screenshot windows 7
And more or less, the machine is done! I left the top of the marquee able to swing open, to reach the speaker power incase he wants them all displayed but not have his house sound like a blasting arcade. There are small touches i need to make but thats about it!.. ALSO, i need to add a little marquee edging to that bottom marquee wood.. a L corner or something.. My next two on deck are dig dug and q-bert. Digdug is nearing completion.
*NOTE, THE MARQUEE AND ALL THAT IS CROOKED.. I DIDNT FULLY CLOSE IT YET. There are still a few changes i have to make so its not 100% locked together yet, so anything that looks off, is because they arent fastened

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

Go to permalink The explosions that devastated Tianjin yesterday were so powerful, they registered as seismic activity by China’s National Earthquake Network. And the “quakes” geophysicists saw don’t even begin to capture the magnitude of the blasts. Yesterday, two explosions originating at a warehouse owned by Tianjin Dongjiang Port Rui Hai International Logistics Co. ripped through the port city of Tianjin, smashing buildings and cars and leaving an apocalyptic scene in their wake. The first explosion was enormous, and the second was even bigger: the China Earthquake Networks Center is comparing it to 21 metric tons of TNT . A hundred miles northwest in Beijing, a seismometer station picked up the blasts as the equivalent of magnitude 2.3 and 2.9 earthquakes on the Ritcher scale. Advertisement Seismometers in Beijing detected the second Tianjin explosion as the equivalent of a 2.9 earthquake. Image via USGS Now, this doesn’t mean the explosions actually caused earthquakes: A seismometer simply measures motion in the ground due to propagating waves of energy. We typically use seismometers to detect tectonic activity, but they also register plenty of human technologies, including dynamite, airguns, and sonar. According to John Bellini, a geophysicist with the USGS, seismometers pick up man-made explosions in quarries all the time. “We record dozens of them [explosions] every day in quarries and around world,” Bellini told Gizmodo. “Usually they’re in a known region, and they do look different from an earthquake on a seismometer.” Part of the reason quarry explosions look different from quakes, Bellini says, is that they’re typically not point-source events. Instead miners will drill a bunch of boreholes over a couple acres and scatter explosives throughout them. This helps to minimize the overall impact of the explosion and prevent damage to the surrounding region. What’s interesting about the Tianjin explosions is that these were point source events, and what’s more, they didn’t take place underground. Usually, we can’t detect surface explosions very well, because most of their energy dissipates into the air. The fact that the Tianjin explosion is registering on seismometers, and with as much energy as a small-sized earthquake, speaks to just how monstrously powerful these explosions were. Smoke billows from the site of an explosion that reduced a parking lot filled with new cars to charred remains at a warehouse in northeastern China’s Tianjin municipality, Thursday, Aug. 13, 2015. Image via Ng Han Guan / AP “Imagine where the blast occurred: right at the surface,” Bellini said. “Most of the force is going to be blown upward away from the ground. Whereas a quarry blast, for instance — generally the explosion is buried in the ground or in an underground mine. It takes a lot smaller explosion in a mine blast to be seen on a seismometer as the same size event.” “A quarry blast with this much explosive energy would probably register as an upper 3 to a low 4 quake,” Bellini continued. “The larger quarry blasts I’ve seen are in the low 4 range, and that happens several times a year in quarry mines.” Fire fighters in protective gear watch partially pink smoke continue to billow after an explosion at a warehouse in northeastern China’s Tianjin municipality, Thursday.

In fact, determining the total amount of energy released by explosions like these isn’t a very easy thing to do. First, because our units of measure suck : We should be measuring explosions like this in joules of energy rather than tons of TNT. Second, because different types of explosions generate different types of waves , which affects how the energy is propagated and how much damage the blast ultimately inflicts. The best way to appreciate the magnitude of the explosion might be the human toll: So far, there have been 50 confirmed deaths and more than 500 hospitalizations.

( 6,750 followers) Wal-Mart Beats Back The Critics With Strong Performance Nov. 18, 2015 1:18 AM ET | About: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) by: ColoradoWealthManagementFund Summary Wal-Mart’s revenue was lower year over year, but it was significantly positive after adjusting for foreign exchange. Comparable sales remained positive as Wal-Mart continued to bring in more customers year over year. Operating income is down but we are seeing the most difficult quarters as Wal-Mart recognizes all of the costs associated with shifting strategies. Wal-Mart’s future depends on growing the grocery segment. Guidance for the rest of the year was quite reasonable even as the company handles negative foreign exchange impacts and costs of improving the workforce.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) delivered a very solid third quarter and beat on earnings even as they missed sales estimates. The earnings report was easy for investors to underestimate if they didn't look too hard. Critics point to Wal-Mart delivering a decrease in revenue year over year by 1.6%. That sounds pretty terrible, but when investors dig deeper, it turns out that Wal-Mart's performance was much more bullish than bearish. Total Revenue
The challenge with simply measuring total revenue is that it severely punishes Wal-Mart for having global distribution in a period where the dollar increased dramatically in strength. The impact of converting from foreign currency to U.S. dollars resulted in what appeared to be declining sales. For critics, that is enough to suggest that the company is failing as consumers rapidly flock to alternatives. Unfortunately, for the bears, that is simplistic at best.
International sales were down 11.4% year over year, which sounds like a retailer that has been thoroughly smashed in international markets. However, when adjusting for the impact of changes in the exchange rate, the international sales would have been up 3.2% and total sales would have been up 2.8%.
When we look at the domestic market and drill in to the performance of individual stores, the company saw comparable sales increasing 1.5% with traffic up 1.7%. That indicates that sales per transaction were down slightly, but there was certainly no decrease in the number of people walking into the Wal-Mart stores. Operating Income
The difficulty for Wal-Mart comes from declining operating income. This is something management warned shareholders about as the benefits of investing in their workforce should take time to materialize. Over time, the company should see employer turnover decrease which results in a more effective workforce. In the first several quarters, Wal-Mart will see weaker margins as a function of paying out higher wages to retain more talented employees, but over time, it results in a better working atmosphere with more capable employees.
While shareholders would like to believe that employees are going to work as hard as possible from the first day they report to work, the reality of the situation is that a skilled workforce takes time to develop. Even though Wal-Mart designs jobs to avoid excessive complexity at any of the lower levels, there is still a material difference between the production of a fast cashier and a slow cashier.
Even when it comes to stocking shelves, the fastest worker and the slowest worker will get work done at very different rates and I believe the difference in the rate of work dramatically surpasses the difference in the pay per employee. If Wal-Mart is able to make the transition to a longer tenured workforce, it should lead to less employees being needed per store and superior operation. Future Impact of Shifting Strategy
On the other hand, if the ""order online and we'll load your car"" strategy picks up steam, we may see higher volumes of employees but more pricing power as picking up the groceries without entering the store is a material advantage that will encourage busy customers to prioritize Wal-Mart over stores that require more physical presence in the ""shopping"" process. As Wal-Mart rolls out the program and continues to monitor the success in sample markets, they will have to make the decision about adjusting staffing levels and prices. I'd certainly be willing to pay a higher price for that service.
Someone reading this is going to think that I'm suggesting that simply by paying more for labor, a company can improve their talent pool. That is precisely correct. Higher wages lead to longer tenure and better applicants as well as motivating employees to work harder. Before I worked in finance, I worked in management. Compensation impacts effort. This has Nothing to do with Amazon
Some critics will believe that somehow ""declining revenue"" is related to excessive competition from other companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). That myth should be dispelled simply by recognizing that same store sales were improving and total revenue was up materially on a constant currency basis. Regardless, there is some competition when it comes to non-food items.
Wal-Mart's best performing section is their neighborhood grocery department, which saw comp sales increasing by 8%. That is a fairly strong metric and the grocery department is one of the highly desirable areas for growing sales due to the margins on the grocery business and the importance of scale since products have severely limited shelf life. Wal-Mart understands that their major area of growth is being the dominant grocery store in the United States and to a lesser extent across the world.
Shifting their strategy to incorporate higher wages and a higher standard of service for customers reflects a keen understanding of the importance of dominating the grocery segment. Allowing customers to shop online and pick up groceries in person is excellent for driving growth as the company is able to track consumer buying habits significantly better. It also allows them to do a better job of reducing their waste of food products.
There are significant impacts from customers assuming that the last vegetable or fruit must be fundamentally flawed. There are issues with consumers searching for the freshest loaf of bread or gallon of milk that result in products becoming substantially more difficult to sell as soon as the shelf is restocked. By shifting to selling products online, Wal-Mart should see gains in their operations on the grocery side from a material reduction in the rate of spoilage. Leveraging this ability gives Wal-Mart a solid way to reinforce their role as a low cost leader. Guidance
Management provided guidance for the fourth quarter, which includes earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.55, compared to $1.53 last year. Yes, the average of this range would suggest a reduction in EPS but this is during one of the most costly periods in the transition to a higher service business with longer tenured employees. Over the next year, I think Wal-Mart will report their weakest earnings of the next decade. While the temporary reduction in earnings may seem painful, this will pass. Shareholders can console themselves with bargain bin prices on one of the greatest dividend champions in the market.

"Quote: : kibort how does the laser make marks on the floor? do you rotate the car forward so that the lasers are poiting down?
I dont understand that part Mark,
Dr Bob's laser levels are identical to mine- the black projector or whatever it is called that the beam emits from is polarised [correct term?] in that rotating it through 90 degees creates a beam that can be oriented either vertical or horizontal [or any angle in between]. I orient mine vertical so that when projected onto the wall I see a clear vertical line.
In my situation at the moment I project two parallel beams down the side of the car sitting each laser level on top of two axle stands thus I have a vertical beam passing along the side of the car close to the wheels and then I simply measure the distance from the beam to the front wheel rims forward [9 0'cloxk]and aft [3 O'clock] at the horizontal centreline. During the setup process I ensure that the separation of the two beams is the same in front of and behind the car. You can do this referencing the laser line image on the floor or you can do it projected onto a wall. The longer the laser line length the more accurate the setup will be.
The difference between the readings for both front wheels gives the total toe. To understand the toe setting for each wheel I will need to calibrate the beams to ensure they are parallel both sides. I now know the difference between the position of the front hub caps and rear hub caps so that should be relatively easy to set up- a bit fiddly but ""doable"".

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

@EmmaCunningham @simplymeasured that's hilarious
12.17.2015 Why Instagram is the Most Important Social Media Tool of 2016 By now, almost everyone has Instagram. But not only is it a fun tool, it's become THE optimal tool to use to grow your blog or business. Since Facebook overtook the app, it's now easy to advertise on Instagram and sharing photos has become necessary to gain steady followers. In 2015, brands and users have steadily increased in all aspects of posting, hashtagging, and even sharing videos on Instagram. Basically, everyone is using Instagram more than ever. 35% of users use an emoji in every post (most brands use the camera or the heart emoji) but users use all different kinds. Simply Measured proved in a 2015 study that Starbucks gains interest, engagement and likes bu using target emojis, specific hashtags, and topical content that appeals to the audience. Instagram is the fastest growing social network of 2015 , and it shows no signs of slowing down in 2016. There are over 400 million people on Instagram each MONTH! On top of that, it's not just a large audience but a highly engaged audience. In fact, it's set to be the MOST interactive and engaging app of 2016. So, how do you get noticed? It's important to look at your analytics, this helps you find the best time to post. Take a look the hashtags that work and when your followers are most engaged. Using hashtags, posting at the right time, and taking beautiful photos are just some of the ways to get your followers engaged and to grow your audience organically. Posting often, with intention, helps you to continue to increase engagement. But, what do you post? When? How often? How do you get reposted by big brands? And how do you increase likes and followers without selling your soul? And most important: How do you turn followers into an interested, engaged audience that reads your blog?! I reveal all my secrets and answer all of the above in Instagram for Success. In less than one year I've gained over 10,000 followers and my likes have quadrupled . Here's a post from last year at this time: Dec 10, 2014 at 3:13pm PST Here's a post from this year: A photo posted by Helene Sula (@heleneinbetween) on Nov 17, 2015 at 10:18am PST This isn't luck, it's a proven formula I've used time and time again to grow my Instagram following.

It's a tough job to convince anyone to upgrade from on-board audio, for the very good reason that most integrated sound chips are good enough for the majority's needs. Having made the decision to upgrade, should you be looking at something a little grander?
We've used Rightmark's Audio Analyzer tool to give a top level breakdown of the card's performance. It's worth pointing out that this simply measuring variations in tones via a loopback from the speaker to the mic channel – effectively the card is listening to itself.
RMAA total harmonic distortion 24-bit/48KHz (lower is better)
Intel on board: 0.131%
Creative X-Fi Titanium HD: 0.0020%
ASUS Xonar Xense: 0.0004%
ASUS DG: 0.0027%
RMAA Dynamic range 24-bit/48KHz (higher is better)
Intel on board: 90.4dBA
Creative X-Fi Titanium HD: 113.2dBA
ASUS Xonar Xense: 115.0dBA
ASUS Xonar DG: 103.3dBA
Noise level 24-bit/48KHz (lower is better)
Intel on board: -90.4
Creative X-Fi Titanium HD: -113.4dBa
ASUS Xonar Xense: -116.1dBA
ASUS Xonar HD: -103/4dBa
The Xonar DG gets as close to its claimed stats as any card we've tested in the Rightmark tests, which is a good start. Subjectively, it also delivers on its promise of outperforming on-board audio by a long way. The headphone amp in particular, which can be tuned for high impedance headsets up to 150ohms is an exceptionally good touch at this price.
If you game through headphones, this is well worth the upgrade, with a powerful bass blast that doesn't drown out more subtle midtones and high range effects. For this alone, we'd choose the DG over the slightly more expensive Creative X-Fi Xtreme."

"We have another of those murmurations about wealth inequality in the UK press today. And the problem is that the complaints are about something that's just going to happen anyway. Simply because that's the way that wealth distributions work: the top 10% are going to have something like 50% of the wealth, the bottom 50% are going to have some insignificant part of the wealth of the country. This is so for two reasons: firstly, lifetime effects upon wealth and secondly the way we count what is wealth and what is not.There is thus no surprise about the levels of wealth concentration we are seeing, that are being complained about. This is just the way this calculation will always turn out, it's like complaining that apples fall from trees, not rise up out of them.The background is that the Office of National Statistics has released the figures on what wealth concentration is in the UK :
Britain’s richest households have pulled further ahead of the rest of the population as house prices have accelerated, with the top 10% now owning almost half of the country’s £11.1tn total private wealth.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average household was worth £225,100 in 2012-14, when it carried out its latest survey of the country’s assets.Since the previous survey two years earlier, the top tenth of households had seen a 21% increase in their wealth, including property and shares. That was three times as fast as the increase over the same period for the poorest half of households, who saw their wealth rise by 7%. This just is not a surprise : It meant the wealthiest 10 per cent owned 45 per cent of the country’s private wealth, worth just under £5 trillion, while the poorest half owned just 9 per cent, or just under £1 trillion.Middle income families shared a total wealth of just over £5 trillion in 2012-14, a rise of 17 per cent in two years. Overall private wealth grew by 18 per cent to £11.1 trillion. Everyone is getting wealthier, which is good. And that wealth is distributed unevenly, which is simply normal.The go to paper on wealth distributions is the one by Saez and Zucman. And here's what they say in it about wealth distributions : The second key result of our analysis involves the dynamics of the bottom 90% wealth share.The bottom half of the distribution always owns close to zero wealth on net.36 Hence, thebottom 90% wealth share is the same as the share of wealth owned by top 50-90% families—what can be described as the middle class. Note what they say: ""always"". And this is in the paper that fueled the worries over wealth concentration in the first place. The thing that Saez and Zucman are pointing to is the concentration of wealth into the 1 and 0.1% groups, not the simple fact that the bottom 50% will have almost no wealth and that the top 10% will have some half of it. That's not something they think is an issue nor is it really anything we can do anything about.The reason for this is twofold. As I pointed out here what we measure as wealth is a little odd. We don't measure all of the things that we already do to reduce wealth inequality. We deliberately ignore the state pension (in the UK a capital value of perhaps £100,000), we ignore lifetime tenancies in below market rent housing (we count only housing owned minus mortgages), we don't even count many public sector pensions as they're not fully funded. But they're all wealth and should be counted as such.So, one reason our measured wealth inequality is so high is simply because we're ignoring the influence of the entire tax and benefits system: let alone the wealth effects of government supplied services. That the NHS provides free at the point of use medical treatment most certainly has an impact upon wealth. We need only to look to China for that: one reason for the country's vast savings rate (up to 50% of GDP at times) is that people must save to pay for their own likely medical treatment.We're simply measuring wealth wrong.The other is that we're not taking account of lifetime effects. For almost all of us there's a time in our lives when we have no net wealth. And other times of our lives when we have substantial net wealth. The student leaving college with tuition debt has negative net wealth. That applies to perhaps 50% of the relevant age cohort in both the US and UK. That same student will likely have substantial net wealth 30 years later in the form of housing equity and a pension or two (both of which are counted as wealth, if the pension is private sector). Is this something for us to complain about? Or should we perhaps be looking to measure wealth rather more accurately in the first place?The truth is that people are near deliberately misunderstanding these wealth distribution figures. It's simply normal for the bottom 50% to have little of the recorded wealth of the society. Partly because some are young and just don't have any of that wealth they will achieve, partly because of the strange way that we measure wealth: deliberately excluding the things we do to equalise wealth.Yes, these figures make lovely headlines to enrage people with. But the truth is that outside that 0.1 and 0.01%, there's nothing very strange at all about the wealth distribution in the UK. It is, for example, less unequal that the wealth distribution of Sweden."

Thursday, December 10, 2015 Are Manchester United Really Progressing Under Louis van Gaal? Louis van Gaal insists Man Utd are heading in the right direction. We analyse their progress under the Dutchman... Van Gaal conceded he was left in an indefensible position by Manchester United's dismal Champions League exit. But his defiant claims of progress jarred after another frustrating fixture for United supporters. "We went further in the Capital One Cup [this season], qualified for the Champions League group stage, we have played all these matches and are still in a very good position in the league. The facts say we are better than last year." Are United really on a general upward trend? Have they really stepped up to another level from last season? As the Old Trafford faithful prepare for Thursday night Europa League fixtures in February, we take a closer look at Van Gaal's assertions… Premier League There's no doubt, Manchester United are, as Van Gaal says, "in a very good position in the league". Just three points behind surprise leaders Leicester City with almost 40 per cent of the season played, United are in a title race few expected them to be ready for. However, they are only one point better off than they were after 15 games last season. At the same stage in 2014/15, they were a distant third, trailing table-toppers Chelsea by eight points. This term, they are clear beneficiaries of surprising slip-ups from Premier League favourites Manchester City (who have already suffered four defeats) and Arsenal (three defeats), as well as Chelsea's wretched title defence. Of course, it all seems a substantial improvement on the days of David Moyes. After 15 games of the former Everton boss' reign, United were down in ninth, 13 points off the summit. Yet, while United finished the 2013/14 season in seventh, they only managed six more points in Van Gaal's first season. Their 70-point haul earned them fourth - and Champions League qualification - in 2014/15. It would only have been good enough for sixth the previous year. Add to that the growing frustration among fans towards Van Gaal's possession-dominated style - four 0-0s in the Premier League, no team in the top seven has scored fewer goals - and it seems a positive domestic campaign is not assured. Champions League Manchester United's return to the Champions League - thanks to a play-off win over Club Brugge - was seen as a significant milestone in Van Gaal's three-year 'transition' period at the club. Under Moyes, United missed out on European football for the first time in 25 years. At the end of Van Gaal's first season, normality was restored. Yet there was nothing familiar about United's group-phase exit into the Europa League this term. "You should really be cruising through that group and probably qualify with two games to go, resting players with the Premier League in mind," Tony Gale told Soccer Special. "The old United would have done that." In fact, the United of 2013/14 were doing just that under Moyes. While domestically Moyes' men struggled, they cruised to a first-place finish in their Champions League pool, winning four and drawing two of their six games. Robin van Persie's heroics were needed to overcome a first-leg loss at Olympiakos in the round of 16 but a valiant defeat to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals was no embarrassment - a word used to describe United's group phase exit by former players on Tuesday. Capital One Cup It seemed odd for Van Gaal to cite United's Capital One Cup 'run' as evidence of their progress under his management. This season they beat Championship side Ipswich at home before losing on penalties to second-tier Middlesbrough after a goalless draw at Old Trafford. Granted, it was an improvement on the 4-0 defeat Van Gaal's United suffered at then-League One MK Dons in round two of the competition in 2014/15. United's loss to Boro came in the fourth round - but they were granted a bye into round three thanks to their European qualification. Going two rounds deeper into the League Cup seems like a small step forwards at best. It's also worth remembering United were Capital One Cup semi-finalists under Moyes - and only a penalty shootout defeat away from making the final. FA Cup Manchester United face League One Sheffield United in the third round of the FA Cup and, after Tuesday's Champions League exit, Van Gaal picked the competition out, alongside the Premier League, as something the club will "fight for". A first trophy in three years would certainly be a significant sign of progress, should United go on to lift the FA Cup in May. Last season, Van Gaal took United past Yeovil, Cambridge United (after a replay), and Preston before losing to Arsenal in the quarter-finals. Players Progress isn't necessarily simply measured in results. There have been many changes to the Manchester United squad since Van Gaal took charge. Around £250m has been spent on new signings, including a British transfer record fee for Angel Di Maria, who lasted barely a year. In have come Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Victor Valdes, Memphis Depay, Matteo Darmian, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Sergio Romero and Anthony Martial. Gone are Robin van Persie, Nani, Rafael, Javier Hernandez, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Shinji Kagawa, Danny Welbeck, Darren Fletcher and Wilfried Zaha. Are United better off with the squad they have now? Van Gaal conceded earlier this week the playing staff still needs strengthening: "I'm happy with my squad now but we can strengthen the selection still in [certain] positions, for example the left-back position is not so [well] covered." Conclusion In terms of points, Manchester United are little better off in the league this season than they were last. The fortunes of teams around mean they are closer to the summit. Their return to the Champions League ended in disappointment, falling well short of their performance in the competition two seasons ago. There is yet to be a dominant domestic-cup competition victory over a major team in the past two seasons. The club has spent £250m on a high turnover of playing staff. Louis van Gaal is adamant progress is being made. With seven league titles and a Champions League win on his resume, plus Premier League and FA Cup honours still up for grabs, his assessment cannot be dismissed. But the evidence to date suggests there's a lot more progressing to be done. Credit: Skysports.com

i don't think *you* seem to be understanding that the resolving power of the human visual system is quantified.
while the aforementioned chart deals with the normal of 20/20, or 6/6, vision, you can use the calculator to enter *your* visual acuity (VA) and see where *you* can see differences of specified resolution display systems.
yes, it is based on a population-derived ""normal"" that doesn't imply an absolute ""best"". but measuring VA is simply measuring the specific resolving power of your cornea, lens & retina as a system.
research on the resolving power of the human eye far predates pixel-based displays. its not rocket science, it is mathematics.

Reply Reply post # 176 of 187 11/1/15 at 8:04am tryd Joined: Jun 2002 Location: Trondheim, Norway Posts: 108 offline Select All Posts By This User My main use for my Apple TVs is as an entry point to my stereo for streaming music from my Mac. I have my whole library in ALAC on my Mac (with backups on different discs and different locations) - approx. 4 TB data. My DACs do not have HDMI - very few have due to licensing fees for the HDMI-port - it would add a significant amount to the price of a DAC. This doesn't matter much to high-volume TV or amp producers, but to producers selling to low-volume markets it is a deal-breaker.
The old AppleTV was a cheap and easy way of connecting my Mac to my stereo, the new one is useless.
BTW: I just bought a new Marantz receiver to use at my office - it has HDMI, and sounds like shit compared to my 10 year old C-J that it replaced (I moved the C-J back to my living room).
I realize that I'm a (very small) minority here, but the cost of adding TOSLINK to the AppleTV would have been insignificant. I hear people saying ""why should I pay for TOSLINK when I don't need it?"" - well Why should I pay for HDMI when I don't need it? As it is I won't pay for a new AppleTV because I dont need it - so Apple just lost one sale.

Correct, if your vision is better than 20/20. My last measured VA was 20/10 OS & 20/15 OD.
Which is exactly what the more detailed webpage explaining the chart (and linked calculator) says. Enter your VA and get a more specific idea.
Your VA being better than 20/20 does not discredit the science behind measurement of the resolving power of the human eye.
""Its just plain wrong"".
It is not, your assumptions are.
It is math.

http://carltonbale.com/1080p-does-matter/
I've seen this chart years ago. Just looking at the Requirements for 1080P and I'd bet you many already have to small of a TV to see any difference for the distance they are at. Say the average someone sits from their TV is 8 feet. That's pretty Normal right? Well according to that chart, you need around a 70"" TV to have the full benefits of 1080P. Going to 4K you need around a 140"" screen size. If you're around 3 feet from the screen, you can get away with a 30"" or so screen size. This is why 4K is pretty silly. 4K is what you are watching on a huge screen at a movie theater. If you have one of those in your house, great, you need 4K.
This is why so many are happy with 1080P streaming. Most people can't tell it's not Blu-Ray quality because they have to small of a TV for the distance they are at and it looks just fine. Just like a DVD looks just fine and don't see any difference over a Blu-Ray. If you paused it, got up close and took a look, sure you could tell 1080P from 4K. That's just silly.
3D wasn't a big seller to get people to buy a new TV. Now they're trying it with 4K. Spend less money and get a larger 1080P HDTV and be happy with that. Have a nice large wall free to put a picture on, great, 4K may be for you. Maybe you're one of the minority with better eye site. It's still not that good. For most people, it's pointless.

And yet Apple has chosen to support 4K on the iPhone 6S, the iPadPro, new Macs, and video editing software.
And while they're not supporting even limited 4K on the TV, they are supporting 3D which was a dismal commercial failure.

or you can interpret it thusly:
""Apple supports 4k on capture & production devices, while supporting 1080p on it's home theater consumption device.""
The A8 can handle 4k, as shown prior, so it would only require a software update if the time comes. For now, i think concentrating their efforts on content far supersedes a spec war.

anantksundaram - I agree with the others who've said it totally blows to not have the audio out... for the main reason of streaming audio via AirTunes WITHOUT having to have the tv on. This is a deal killer for me -- I don't want an ugly HDMI audio converter extra box to plug in, and i don't want to have to turn on the TV to play music.
I also don't want to always have to turn on the stereo to watch TV on the apple TV, or other sources for that matter (since I'd have to rewire everything through my stereo's HDMI switcher, which is pain). Don't most people use the multiple inputs on the back of the TV, anyway? otherwise, you have to always change remotes/inputs, switch the stereo source, flip back to the cable mode, etc. I hate having to switch sources or remotes all the time. I have one audio return from the TV to the stereo, so that whatever video source the TV is showing, the stereo input is ""TV"". When I listen to music, the stereo input is AUX (apple tv audio).
Am I the only one with this setup? Nope. I have something similar. I don't always want to turn on the sound system to watch TV. Therefore, I don't use the receiver for video switching. All my sources (DVR, ATV, Blu Ray player, Xbox run video to the TV via HDMI and separate digital audio to the A/V receiver. When I want the full experience I turn on the receiver, when I don't the sound comes theough the TV only. Works for me and my family.

3D, which i hate, seems to have more potential for games than movies (since if you are playing a single-player game you sit in one spot, vs. having 6 people over watching a movie at different angles). That might play into it.

No pun intended? ;-)
I don't disagree, but the chief argument in defense of Apples decision not to include 4K, is that there's no content, and nothing in place to deliver it. What you're suggesting is that Apple is supporting a technology that has no significant installed base, not much content, nor delivery systems, either. If they're going to support one, why not the other? Reply Reply post # 186 of 187 11/4/15 at 7:22am SpamSandwich Bazinga Joined: May 2005 Posts: 22,938 offline Select All Posts By This User Quote: :

http://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT205302
And it should be noted that if you pair Bluetooth headphones you'll only be able to use one remote for games. The AppleTV only connects to 2 Bluetooth devices.

THIS VISUALIZATION REVEALS WHAT EMOTIONS AND KEY THEMES THE REVIEWERS MENTIONED MOST OFTEN IN THE REVIEWS. THE LARGER THE WORD THE MORE IT WAS USED BY THE REVIEWERS WHEN DESCRIBING THE TRACK.

guitar interesting strong love beat intro melody rock catchy builds singer bass chorus enjoyable lyrics excellent heavy backing similar nicely riffs cool appealing instruments full tune hard loud drums style instrumental song's metal powerful
REVIEWS
 Beautiful in the beginningbut gradually went rockstar like. I love the artist because he is copying Keshas song. I love how the drum is so rockstar. The key board is great and the drum roll was better. Great song!
 Cool song. The instruments synchronized quite well, and create a nice sounding band. The lead singer is well understood and sings well with the rest of the music in the band. The intro and ending are fine for a rock song like this.
 Interesting build in the intro. Wow and then it thrashing with some drums that really shred. The guitar could come out a bit more and sounds a little muddied by the mix. The lyrics are cool and reflect the music well. The melodies and harmonies in the refrain is cool and adds contrast to the whole product. The call and response between the melody and the guitar in the bridge is cool stuff. The refrain probably isn't catchy enough for this to be a hit, and it is really driven by the awesome drum track.
 An excellent build up, the introduction continues to build on the approach to the verse. This reminds me of a heavier Papa Roach style track. The guitar riffs are sharp and catchy and they are some excellent rocking out, head banging moments. The chorus seems to lose it's passion, in the vocals at least, when I feel this is when you should really be singing your heart out. The vocals should differ greatly to the cool, collected vocals used in the verses. The drums are fantastic, really powerful, you clearly have a great drummer. Vocals are wonderful too - the last section is really strong but really sell the chorus, sing it with passion!
 I don't really like this song because it is a bit to hardcore for me. I think that it will be good for people who like this type of music. The lyrics are good because they tell a very strong story but the music is a bit too much for me. I think this song is good for others but not for me.
 i like the drums in this, not the normal. the vocal is ok, nothing special though. would have to wow me with something in a higher range. sounds like every other metal band. maybe some female vocals would help the bridge to chorus. violins maybe? just to give it something unexpected. the bit of rap is not the break i was wanting from this,
 Though very polished and well produced, the opening guitar riffs of this song seem very familiar for the genre. The drum work is very well done and the guitars definitely crunch, but overall the work feels very similar to many other works in its genre. Too similar to be distinguished as unique. The vocalist is very suited for the genre, and the background metal screams were definitely a welcome addition to this listener. Lyrically speaking, they are well done, but, likewise, they seem extremely similar to other works within the genre. Overall, the song is well produced and is certainly polished, but there is not enough that set it apart from other works within in its genre to distinguish it as something unique.
 I like the way all the instruments come in from that build up. The repeat of ""the first thing on my mind"" is unnecessary in the beginning. Some rhymes are kind of cheesy. I don't really understand where the lyrics are going, they kind of ever from their original topic. Also there is no need for the scream when you're talking about a girl when you live. The beat is up beat and has a fast tempo. The instruments blend well together but the register of the guys vocals sound weird. The rap part you can barely hear the lead and it sucks
 this song has movie, sound track all over it, the beat awesome the drums, are killer one of the better punk song i have heard over all good song, not sure if it would make, the chart but would play well.
 The guitar in the song is really good and i enjoyed it. I enjoyed the lyrics except for the little parts were they were screaming. The drum was also really good in the song. If their other songs had screaming I wouldn't listen to them again.
 the drummer that comes out of this song, really sets the tone for the musicin this osng, there is a very intense sound to this mix of music. the singers are deep, there voices carry this in a very distinct way. the lyrics to this are fesh, there genuine and are compelling, this one has a sound to it that is pretty full and vitlaity
 This song's guitar melody has a vibrant heavy metal flavor. The style reminds me a little of Evanescence. The singer's low voice has an appealing edgy tone. I do think he could be a little louder as the background melody overpowers him. The lyrics are interesting...""your love is my drug."" I like the energy of this song. I would definitely purchase it!
 sweet voice and then bass and tune sounds new and different to other songs. like to hear it again. edited well some words are coming fast. background music its fine. like it in full volume . at the end gr8 sound
 Right off the top, the drums are extraordinary! He is working his rear end off putting down those bad riffs. The vocals are full and a right fit for a nice rock n roll song. The lyrics to this song are well organized. The bass guitar could use some compression effect just to set it off some.
 At the opening of this tune, there is quality musicianship in the band that is playing. The tempo is good and feels right. I am not crazy about the heavy distortion that is on the guitar. I believe it is too strong. The lyrics are annunciated well, but they overtaken by the volume of the band. Also, I believe it would help to bring the vocal to the front of the recording. This would make it easier to hear the lyrics. I think you will have pretty good radio play on this tune.
 The song began with a tune that was subtle in the beginning. However it soon grew and I really enjoyed the tune of the guitar. It was very authentic and real. It was highly enjoyable. The drums did a good job at fitting in with the tune of the guitar. They all fit in together very nicely. It was a very interesting piece. The voice of the song was appealing and I really enjoyed the whole song.
 An excellent hard driving beat with powerful guitar riffs. This group ranks up there with Theory Of A Deadman and Five Finger Death Punch. The lyrics are well formulated and the vocalist can be heard above the mix while blending in well. The harmonies are tight and clean and compliment the singer. The vocalist is powerful and in your face with his style but does not come across as overbearing, more subtle and flowing. Everything about the song, including the breaks, work well and this could easily make the top ten rock charts alongside groups like Linken Park and Nickleback. The ending, with the fading crash cymbol puts a nice exclamation point on the whole song. The mix is quite well done and all the instruments blend nicely, especially the drums which can be very hard to mix down. All in all, quite a good track.
 This has an exciting exchange of the electric guitar and the drums. A great sound that has great appeal. A heavy metal sound that has a hip vibe. The vocals mesh well with the music. An advanced musical arrangement with a professional quality sound.
 At many points of the song, I found the background instrumental to have an epic feel to it. It had a lot of cool musical notes that were followed. The instruments worked well together to create this ""epic"" feel to it. The vocals though were quite lacking and quite disappointing. The singer was extremely quiet with his singing, quick made it hard for me to hear the lyrics. I felt that he should've sung louder because the song's instrumental really took over the song. Overall, the song's main outstanding point is its background instrumental. The song would deserve a higher rating if the singer were to sing much louder. There isn't really commercial potential in this song if the voice is lacking.
 Good lead-in. Nice hard hitting bass, treble, and guitar. Like the drum beat as well. The voice of the singer vaguely reminds me of Lincoln Park. I find the chorus very interesting and catchy. I can see this song being big if marketed right. Very nicely done. Needs more backup vocals though :)

i don't think *you* seem to be understanding that the resolving power of the human visual system is quantified.
while the aforementioned chart deals with the normal of 20/20, or 6/6, vision, you can use the calculator to enter *your* visual acuity (VA) and see where *you* can see differences of specified resolution display systems.
yes, it is based on a population-derived ""normal"" that doesn't imply an absolute ""best"". but measuring VA is simply measuring the specific resolving power of your cornea, lens & retina as a system.
research on the resolving power of the human eye far predates pixel-based displays. its not rocket science, it is mathematics.

Reply Reply post # 176 of 187 11/1/15 at 8:04am tryd Joined: Jun 2002 Location: Trondheim, Norway Posts: 108 offline Select All Posts By This User My main use for my Apple TVs is as an entry point to my stereo for streaming music from my Mac. I have my whole library in ALAC on my Mac (with backups on different discs and different locations) - approx. 4 TB data. My DACs do not have HDMI - very few have due to licensing fees for the HDMI-port - it would add a significant amount to the price of a DAC. This doesn't matter much to high-volume TV or amp producers, but to producers selling to low-volume markets it is a deal-breaker.
The old AppleTV was a cheap and easy way of connecting my Mac to my stereo, the new one is useless.
BTW: I just bought a new Marantz receiver to use at my office - it has HDMI, and sounds like shit compared to my 10 year old C-J that it replaced (I moved the C-J back to my living room).
I realize that I'm a (very small) minority here, but the cost of adding TOSLINK to the AppleTV would have been insignificant. I hear people saying ""why should I pay for TOSLINK when I don't need it?"" - well Why should I pay for HDMI when I don't need it? As it is I won't pay for a new AppleTV because I dont need it - so Apple just lost one sale.

You say that as though I don’t know these things or that the statement somehow invalidates what I said.
Given the content and given the display, I can see things further than the chart says. Period.

Correct, if your vision is better than 20/20. My last measured VA was 20/10 OS & 20/15 OD.
Which is exactly what the more detailed webpage explaining the chart (and linked calculator) says. Enter your VA and get a more specific idea.
Your VA being better than 20/20 does not discredit the science behind measurement of the resolving power of the human eye.
""Its just plain wrong"".
It is not, your assumptions are.
It is math.

http://carltonbale.com/1080p-does-matter/
I've seen this chart years ago. Just looking at the Requirements for 1080P and I'd bet you many already have to small of a TV to see any difference for the distance they are at. Say the average someone sits from their TV is 8 feet. That's pretty Normal right? Well according to that chart, you need around a 70"" TV to have the full benefits of 1080P. Going to 4K you need around a 140"" screen size. If you're around 3 feet from the screen, you can get away with a 30"" or so screen size. This is why 4K is pretty silly. 4K is what you are watching on a huge screen at a movie theater. If you have one of those in your house, great, you need 4K.
This is why so many are happy with 1080P streaming. Most people can't tell it's not Blu-Ray quality because they have to small of a TV for the distance they are at and it looks just fine. Just like a DVD looks just fine and don't see any difference over a Blu-Ray. If you paused it, got up close and took a look, sure you could tell 1080P from 4K. That's just silly.
3D wasn't a big seller to get people to buy a new TV. Now they're trying it with 4K. Spend less money and get a larger 1080P HDTV and be happy with that. Have a nice large wall free to put a picture on, great, 4K may be for you. Maybe you're one of the minority with better eye site. It's still not that good. For most people, it's pointless.

And yet Apple has chosen to support 4K on the iPhone 6S, the iPadPro, new Macs, and video editing software.
And while they're not supporting even limited 4K on the TV, they are supporting 3D which was a dismal commercial failure.
Kind of a mixed message for the Apple apologists isn't it? Reply Reply post # 181 of 187 11/2/15 at 9:18am sandor Joined: Jun 2007 Location: Philadelphia, Pa Posts: 219 offline Select All Posts By This User Quote: :

or you can interpret it thusly:
""Apple supports 4k on capture & production devices, while supporting 1080p on it's home theater consumption device.""
The A8 can handle 4k, as shown prior, so it would only require a software update if the time comes. For now, i think concentrating their efforts on content far supersedes a spec war.

anantksundaram - I agree with the others who've said it totally blows to not have the audio out... for the main reason of streaming audio via AirTunes WITHOUT having to have the tv on. This is a deal killer for me -- I don't want an ugly HDMI audio converter extra box to plug in, and i don't want to have to turn on the TV to play music.
I also don't want to always have to turn on the stereo to watch TV on the apple TV, or other sources for that matter (since I'd have to rewire everything through my stereo's HDMI switcher, which is pain). Don't most people use the multiple inputs on the back of the TV, anyway? otherwise, you have to always change remotes/inputs, switch the stereo source, flip back to the cable mode, etc. I hate having to switch sources or remotes all the time. I have one audio return from the TV to the stereo, so that whatever video source the TV is showing, the stereo input is ""TV"". When I listen to music, the stereo input is AUX (apple tv audio).
Am I the only one with this setup? Nope. I have something similar. I don't always want to turn on the sound system to watch TV. Therefore, I don't use the receiver for video switching. All my sources (DVR, ATV, Blu Ray player, Xbox run video to the TV via HDMI and separate digital audio to the A/V receiver. When I want the full experience I turn on the receiver, when I don't the sound comes theough the TV only. Works for me and my family.

3D, which i hate, seems to have more potential for games than movies (since if you are playing a single-player game you sit in one spot, vs. having 6 people over watching a movie at different angles). That might play into it.

No pun intended? ;-)
I don't disagree, but the chief argument in defense of Apples decision not to include 4K, is that there's no content, and nothing in place to deliver it. What you're suggesting is that Apple is supporting a technology that has no significant installed base, not much content, nor delivery systems, either. If they're going to support one, why not the other? Reply Reply post # 186 of 187 11/4/15 at 7:22am SpamSandwich Bazinga Joined: May 2005 Posts: 22,839 offline Select All Posts By This User Quote: :

http://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT205302
And it should be noted that if you pair Bluetooth headphones you'll only be able to use one remote for games. The AppleTV only connects to 2 Bluetooth devices.

"(I really hesitated over where to put this -- maybe it should be CS because it's sorta about food but really about physics, I think so.... apologies to the mod if you have to move it.)
Anyway, I've had multiple toasters over my life, and NONE of them have done what it seems to me like the most basic thing a toaster should do. As in, when you put a slice of bread into the thing, it should come out cooked to your desired shade of brown/crunchiness time after time after time. I mean, really, is that too much to ask for?
I finally looked up (yes, I googled it!) how toasters work. And apparently there are two types and neither can be expected to reliably do what I want.
One group simply measures the temperature within the slot, and when it reaches some particular point it declares the toast done. And what the 'darkenss' control on those do is change the target temperature. Which sounds good, except that it makes a huge difference if the toaster starts out cold or hot. So the first batch of toast will be browner than another batch made soon after. So I guess what you'd need to do is create a whole lot of unsatisfying toast while you figure it out: let's see, I need the first batch to be at 3, and the second at 6, though if it's been two minutes maybe a 4? Or a 5, since the kitchen is rather chilly this morning it probably cooled faster....
The other kind of toasters use some magic gizmos called variable capacitors and resisters which I do not even pretend to understand, but the bottom line is that they work by time: setting the darkness control changes how fast something charges up, and when the appropriate degree of charge is reached it goes pop.
Which is supposedly consistent batch to batch... as long as you're putting the exact same type of bread into the toaster. But the setting to get the same degree of toastedness for white bread might be quite different than for whole wheat and rye different again. And I bet how thick the slice is matters, too. And whether the loaf was baked yesterday or five days ago. And maybe the phase of the moon matters, too, I dunno.
Isn't there a better way to do this?
My guess is that toasting bread is pretty much the same as other cooking: the heat makes certain chemical changes happen AND some amount of water evaporates. So couldn't you have toasters check on those things instead?
Okay, chemical analysis is probably ridiculously hard (though maybe some optical sensor that detects the degree of color change?) but maybe you could detect the change in how much water is left or the rate it's changing at or something?
I want perfect toast, dammit! If we can put a man on the moon, and all that."

"Decking The Halls: My Christmas Kitchen Window! Dec 7 2015 Leave a Comment
Sheesh, this month is going to go by so fast! I’m actually very excited to be sharing this post with you today. I finally have my kitchen window finished, and it’s all decked out for the holidays!
This year, I teamed up with 17 other bloggers to share some holiday vignette ideas as part of the Deck the Halls DIY-Style Tour, hosted by Jen from The House of Wood . There are lots of great mantel projects going on that you should check out, but since my living room mantel is about 80% television these days, I thought I’d do something a little different and look to another spot in the house that I’ve always wanted to decorate for Christmas.
This faux Roman shade has been a long time coming, and now that it’s done, I realize that unlike most projects, I was putting this one off for good reason. To be honest, I kind of struggled putting it together! But now that I have a chance to rest my back, I can happily say it was worth it, though hopefully some of this info will help save you some time if you attempt the same project. ;)
First, I started by looking at a couple of tutorials on how to make an actual Roman shade, but my lazier side won when I saw that some had just tacked the window fabric together to look like a proper shade instead of making it functional. Since I don’t plan on using the shade itself, that seemed easier, but I underestimated my lack of patience with learning how to pin folds just so . Honestly, I think it would have gone much easier if I hadn’t been working with this particular fabric, but I went with it because it was inexpensive and I had been on kind of a long search to find it. Surprisingly, black and white stripes of this width were hard to find; I had been casually looking whenever I went to a store that had fabric, but kept coming up empty-handed. I finally found some $7.99 per yard and wound up using just one yard to put it together.
The main challenge was that the fabric was heavyweight upholstery, so I wasn’t used to working with it much. The wrinkles were hard to get out, and I found myself struggling to find the right balance between ironing it thoroughly and avoiding the consequences of pressing too long…
I swear, someday I’ll have this adulting thing figured out.
Anyway, I used some Heat n’ Bond to make the curtain no-sew. Starting with the edge that was pre-cut (so I was working from a straight line), I simply measured 3/4″ extra on the sides and bottom so that it was wider than my window (because the Heat n’ Bond was 3/4″ wide, so I’d need that much extra when folding over the sides).
It’s actually pretty easy to use; you just fold the fabric over and press with a hot iron to get your crease, then tuck the Heat n’ Bond into the fold and press again. The strip melts the two sides together, and boom: you’ve got your clean edge. I could have folded it over a second time to get a more perfect-looking hem on the back, but I didn’t for three reasons: that would have made the edge a lot thicker than I wanted it seemed like overkill for a curtain facing my back yard (I mean, no one’s going to see the back much!) and most importantly: I wasn’t in the mood to re-cut and add another 3/4″ all the way around
Once I had the fabric done on the three sides that would be exposed, I wrapped the top around a scrap piece of 1×2 furring strip that I had in my garage, and then went about trying to get it attached inside of the window frame. Since this proved to be kind of difficult keeping it perfectly straight while trying to simultaneously drill the ends into the frame with the other hand, I worked out a small solution to be my extra hands.
By tacking up a couple of extra nails on the sides of the window, I could rest the wood in place (resting on top of the nails) and concentrate on drilling several 2″-long screws vertically through the furring strip and into the window frame (I recommend pre-drilling as well to keep the furring strip from splitting, but with inexpensive scrap wood like this, there’s a chance that will happen anyway).
Once attached, I began the process of gathering the fabric and pinning in various places to create my loops and folds to create the Roman shade look (the pins are visible up close, but you can’t really see them if you aren’t looking for it). This part took longer than I thought, and I realized that I might have had better luck creating the folds first and then hanging it, but I originally decided against it because I worried that the pins would come loose as I wrestled with getting it into place (plus, working with stripes can make it really obvious if something’s not hanging just right, and I didn’t want to have to take it down a second time if it was wrong). I suppose either method can work, so just do what makes sense to you. My decision was kind of also made for me since I couldn’t find my pins until after hanging it up; because of course that’s how losing things work!
After the shade was up, the rest of the window came together quickly. I had most of the stuff on hand already (source list below), and sprinkled in one or two new items, like the petite berry wreath (which I hung with a clear command hook for easy removal later) and the shiny red reindeer on the right. My kitchen unfortunately doesn’t get a lot of light from the rest of the room (the windows are pretty much all on one side), so I really wish the photos had turned out a little better. (Maybe Santa will bring me a lighting kit for Christmas?)
Whenever I need something a little extra for filling in blank spaces, I like to use items from the dollar store. Originally, the glittery pine cones and such were part of a fake poinsettia stem, which I took apart for other decor in the house.
Usually, it’s pretty easy to disassemble; just find the base of the piece that you want and yank. If something is hot glued onto a stem, wire cutters will do the trick.
There you have it! I am really happy with the result, and the striped shade will be around permanently… or until I decide to try another round and improve on the look. Since this was my first time creating it, there are things I would do better if I did it over again, but I’m satisfied enough for now to just move on. There’s lots more decorating to do yet! Source list:"
"I'd suggest getting it started because it's much easier to find problems when it's running than part swapping.
Kick it over no throttle no choke to make sure it's not flooded, then try choking. If it doesn't start after a few mins of fiddling pull the plug and kick it over a bunch with no throttle (no need to keep adding gas to a flooded engine). Plug back in and kick over.
After the basics, drip a bit of fuel in the plug hole (0.1oz, like the volume of a water bottle cap). If it's not getting gas it should start right up but might die when that added gas is burned. If it doesn't start then, hold plug on engine block and in a dark garage look for spark.
If all that fails it has a more serious problem. 2 stokes are very simple, they just need gas and spark. The problem is one of those.
although basically true if you have a bad crank seal or reeds that are too worn or low compression it will be a pita to start.
i would try your recommendation of checking spark and then the gas in the plug hole first.
also remove the silencer and inspect the piston rings and cylinder,if all looks well do a compression test.
if the compression test and spark test come back good clean the carb and make sure its clean.
if it still wont run build one of these http://www.thumperta...ing-a-2-stroke/

1 In 2013 and 2014, a research team formed by Advanced Workplace Associates (AWA) and the Center for Evidence-Based Management (CEBMa) set out to determine what is known about effectively measuring knowledge worker productivity. Allsteel was one of the sponsors of this important work. AWA, a London-based workplace strategy consultancy, partnered with CEBMa, an Amsterdam-based organization who “researches” research, to undertake a critical appraisal of the best available academically rigorous evidence about how the productivity of knowledge workers can be measured – reliably and with validity. We think it’s fair to say that everyone associated with workplace making – from workplace strategists, furniture manufacturers, planners/designers, real estate, and facilities managers to the organization for whom the workplace is developed – has been seeking the Holy Grail: a universal, broadly applicable metric for measuring knowledge worker productivity. If only we had it, we could prove that our choices – lower panels, white noise, blue walls, more natural light, etc. – have a positive effect on productivity (or not). We’d be able to prove causation, and have clearer answers about what to do and what not to do to contribute to worker performance – to have proven data instead of subjective opinions. AWA, CEBMa, and their sponsors 1 set out to search for evidence once and for all that such indisputable metrics exist. To identify any and all cause and effect relationships between some aspect of the physical or virtual workplace environment and measureable performance of the knowledge worker occupant. To do so, CEBMa conducted what they call a “rapid evidence assessment” to comb through scholarly, peer-reviewed research published between 1990 and 2013. They extensively searched all major academic databases against a carefully defined set of criteria designed to ensure that only the best quality evidence was included in the study and weed out those that represent merely collective opinions or the latest fad in thinking. Measuring Knowledge Worker Productivity from Workplace Advisory at Allsteel 1 This research project was sponsored by eight organizations in knowledge sectors such as banking, energy, and telecommunications: Allied Bakeries, The British Council, BDO, BP, RBS, Telereal Trillium, and Old Mutual Wealth in the UK, and Allsteel in the US. 2 In attempting to answer this burning question, they formulated a number of related questions. What is meant by knowledge work? What are the appropriate measures? And, how do they relate to organizational, team, and personal productivity? Knowledge Work We often think of knowledge work in terms of what it is not: manual, physical labor requiring body strength or coordination; or something we do routinely, following a consistent set of steps. The term knowledge work was coined in 1954 by Peter Drucker to describe work that occurs primarily because of mental processes rather than physical labor (Drucker, 1954). Since then, many other definitions have been put forward, but they all seem to share several common elements: • Distribution or application of knowledge • Highly educated, autonomous professionals • A work process that is difficult to standardize • Complex and intangible outcomes Appropriate Methods for Measuring Knowledge Work It is widely agreed that, in most cases, we can’t simply measure knowledge worker productivity by applying the same approach we’ve used in manufacturing for decades. In general, manufacturing metrics are based on contrasting input and output or the relationship between production of goods and services and the factors of production used (labor, machinery, raw materials, etc.). While in some cases this productivity formula also applies in the context of knowledge work, research indicates that the higher the level of knowledge work, the more difficult it is to quantify or qualify the results of knowledge worker effort. More complex knowledge work seldom has one single correct or standard outcome, nor are those outcomes usually quantifiable or comparable. In addition, the value of those more complex forms of knowledge work is often determined by the customer for it. And even that is subject to the view of the user. Quality, for example, depends on what is defined as quality by an organization or the perception of a customer. In addition, many studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that, in general, the correlation between subjective and objective productivity measures tends to be low – and therefore they cannot be used interchangeably (Alexander & Wilkins, 1986; Hoffman et al, 1991; Bommer et al 1995; Rich et al 1999; Forth & McNabb, 2004). In other words, there is no standard or single, widely acknowledged metric, method, or set of key performance indicators for measuring the more complex forms of knowledge worker productivity. Knowledge work is so varied and its outputs so intangible that it is not possible to come up with a single universal measure. And, while we might hope that in lieu of that, we can apply related measures like self-reported engagement or other survey data – the subjective measures we mentioned in the above paragraph – very few of them are valid and reliable. Interesting and informative, yes, but – with a few exceptions we’ll discuss below – not scientifically proven proxies for productivity measures. Having said that, organizations can develop situationally relevant metrics for a specific type of knowledge work within a specific organizational context. A team of product 3 developers may have goals for a particular project, for example, like shortening their usual cycle time or for a target sales volume in the first six months after launch. So if the bad, but not terribly surprising, news is that there is no Holy Grail, no clear evidence of a valid, universal cause and effect measurement system we can reliably apply, what’s the good news? While CEBMa’s assessment confirmed that there are not any macro effective causal relationships – “if I do this, I will get ‘X’ result” – they did, however, find several scientifically proven, broadly generalizeable correlations 2 or “proxy measures” – “if this is happening, chances are great that ‘X’ is also happening.” How These Factors Relate to Organizational, Team, and Personal Productivity The strongest correlations they uncovered are all related to a team’s performance. Most of the studies they found conclude that knowledge worker productivity should be assessed on the team level, because: • Knowledge work is not an individual task, but usually performed in collaboration with others on complex tasks that they cannot perform alone. • Team productivity is not simply the sum of individual productivity. • Changes in productivity of an individual knowledge worker may not affect the productivity of other knowledge workers. • The overall productivity of the organization is dependent on the contribution that specific organizational levels (departments, business units, divisions) make towards overall organizational goals. From the review of more than 800 individual research papers and 35 meta analyses, the six factors that had the highest statistical association with the performance of teams involved in knowledge work are: • Social cohesion • Perceived supervisory support • Information sharing • Vision and goal clarity • External communication • Trust 2 We want to reinforce the importance of the distinction we’re making between “causation” and “correlation” because these terms are often confused or used incorrectly. Causation refers to something that results in an effect. If water is heated past its boiling point it will boil. We would all like to have some proven list of workplace attributes – like painting a wall blue – that would result in higher productivity. This is what we’re saying has not been established. Correlation, on the other hand, suggests a relationship between two or more things – if I increase X, Y typically increases or decreases. CEBMa was able to identify several factors that seem to be reliably correlated to certain types of team performance. 4 Knowing these six factors so closely correlate to team performance enables us to focus on what truly matters. This new information will enable organizations to prioritize activities beyond the design of the physical environment – aspects of organizational culture, leadership and management behaviors, performance management systems, workplace design, and technology deployment – to improve social cohesion between teammates, the supportive role of the manager, effective internal and external communication and information sharing, goal clarity, and trust. Social Cohesion The factor with the strongest correlation to team performance is social cohesion. High levels of social cohesion create a psychologically safe environment in which team members feel free to innovate and explore new ways of doing things, take judicious risks, and cooperate and interact with each other. As a result, an exchange of ideas and sharing of information and knowledge is more likely. The strength of the correlation between cohesion and performance depends on the type of team. For example, it strongly predicts performance in teams with uncertain and complex tasks (e.g., major project or R&D teams), and has a higher association with performance in knowledge work teams rather than in production work teams. The research identified four topics that appear to be particularly associated with team performance. These include: team bonding, promoting a safe psychological environment, developing and deepening relationships, and strong interpersonal skills that support development of social cohesion (e.g., consideration, trusting, friendly). It may be obvious why social cohesion is so fundamentally important. In a knowledge business, every person is a knowledge asset bringing to the team and organization the knowledge, experiences, and relationships gathered throughout their lives. It is the fusion of one person’s knowledge, experience, and relationship assets with those of others in the organization that creates the new knowledge that propels the organization forward and eventually turns into commercial value. For that to work, people need to be willing and comfortable contributing their knowledge and ideas. Social cohesion involves perceptions and feelings, so self- assessments are the most valid method of measurement (as opposed to assessments made by external observers such as managers). 5 A sample question – to which respondents can select from a range of five ratings from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” – might be: “Members of our team help each other on the job.” Perceived Supervisory Support Perceived supervisory support has been shown to have a positive association with knowledge workers’ team performance, and was even more important for teams with roles that span team and/or organizational boundaries. Perceptions form when team members receive feedback from and interact with their supervisor. They are strengthened by team members’ feelings about supervisor help (e.g., giving praise in time of need), or for extra effort. Team members perceive supervisory support in a positive way when a supervisor builds a positive motivational climate. This leads to teams feeling more satisfied in their work. Research shows that team members’ perception of supervisor support impacts their performance, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Recent research has also highlighted those particular behaviors and competencies that foster positive perceptions of supervisory support, such as: • Setting a positive emotional tone and demonstrating integrity. • Proactively problem-solving workload issues. • Being available to the team, encouraging team discussion, understanding what motivates the team and individuals. • Managing conflict fairly and following up on issue resolution. As a result, supervisors who treat team members well can expect them to act in ways that are of mutual value. An example of a question that can be used to measure perceived supervisory support, using the same rating scale as before, is: “My supervisor is willing to extend him or herself in order to help me perform my job to the best of my ability.” Many organizations already gather data through existing surveys or performance measurement tools, so it is worth seeing what is already gathered along these lines before creating new initiatives. Information Sharing In this context we use “information sharing” to refer to the extent to which teams utilize each member’s distinctive knowledge for the team’s benefit – and members are willing and happy to make their knowledge available for others to share. Information sharing enhances innovation and team performance, and has particular importance when team tasks and problems are complex and involve developing new ideas. Therefore, it is particularly critical in organizations that rely on knowledge-worker teams to deliver products and services. Essentially, it is how teams build a mutual understanding of their collective knowledge held in the form of collective memory that enables information sharing. The positive effect of information sharing on team performance is explained by: • Decision making: As more team members share information, the better their decisions will be, leading to better team performance (Hackman, 1990). 6 • Team processes: Enhanced coordination and more efficient and effective team processes result. They create a common understanding of work being done, and awareness of “who knows what” in the team. An example question, using the same rating scale as before, is: “Our team members share their experience or know-how with other team members.” As noted above, it is worth seeing what information is already gathered on this topic before creating anything new. Vision and Goal Clarity Essentially, “vision” sets direction and “goal clarity” specifies what the team should focus on. Studies have demonstrated that a clear team vision tends to positively impact team performance. While clearly stated goals seem to help team members channel their efforts, they also give their work meaning, and in turn, motivate teams to enhance their performance. When team members are committed to those goals, and share a sense of purpose and responsibility, team effectiveness is enhanced. As a result, team members have a common direction, and this enhances cooperation. More than that, clear goals help team members connect their personal values and team values, and experience more meaning and self-affirmation from their work. Finally, a clear vision, owing to its future focus, provides both a rationale for the team’s existence and standards by which team performance can be measured. As such, a clear vision and commitment to long-term goals helps encourage judicious risk taking, experimenting with new approaches and team member responsibility to produce results. The research identified five topics that appear to be particularly associated with team performance: • A shared team vision • Goals that are challenging and achievable • Discussion of long-term goals with the team • Provision of regular feedback • Commitment to team goals An example question is: “If I have more than one goal to accomplish, I know which ones are most important and which are least important.” 7 External Communication By external communication we mean team interactions that include being “…proactive with outsiders, seeking information and resources, interpreting signals, and molding external opinion.” Research shows that external communication requires teams to span across boundaries, both within the organization and sometimes with teams in other organizations. Teams involved in external communication were found to undertake four activities: • Mapping the environment outside the team in order to know who supports or does not support the team. • Persuading and influencing to represent the team in a positive light if resources are needed or, if necessary, in a less positive light. • Coordinating plans and deadlines, and negotiating to align them with other teams. • Synthesizing, interpreting and contextualizing information from outsiders to integrate it into existing databases. Only then can a team act on it. External communication fosters innovation through interpersonal relations with people outside a team or organization. The more external communication team members experience with other teams, the more likely they are to be innovative, as access to diverse information and connections with people from different backgrounds and viewpoints reduces team pressure to conform to existing ideas. Also, networks of professionals may be particularly helpful to knowledge workers since they are particularly valuable sources of new knowledge and ideas. Interactions with outsiders enhance the likelihood of obtaining new knowledge and perspectives. These in turn spark the development of new ideas (creativity) or the adoption of new ways of doing things (innovation). Teams participating in external communication can also experience better technical quality, faster delivery to market, and being more often within budget. The research identified three topics that appear to be closely associated with team performance: • Access to relevant and important external networks. • “Boundary spanning” activities (i.e., operating beyond the team’s own boundary). • Support for new knowledge and ideas. An example question, using the same rating scale as before, is: “Our team scans the external environment for ideas and solutions.” 8 Trust Trust is “…created by the expectation that the actions of the other person(s) will be at one’s benefit or at least not detrimental to him or her.” It refers to feelings about having regard for others. Positive exchanges of expectations and experiences are important for building trust. Demonstrating trust, worry that another person’s actions will be based on self-interest. Trust seems to develop in two directions: • Horizontally: directed at colleagues and team members. Teams expect decisions by team members to take collective interests into account, rather than act only in self-interest. • Vertically: the trust employees have in management to take into account the interests of employees when taking actions. In addition, procedural justice – the fairness of the procedures used to determine organizational outcomes – is an important mechanism that operates within things like performance appraisal systems, professional development opportunities and job security; and tends to explain perceptions of management trustworthiness. There is a positive relationship between trust and team performance; leading to positive consequences such as acceptance of influence, openness in communication, team commitment and cooperation. Team performance relies on an individual team member’s willingness to share and exchange information and knowledge. Therefore, trust in team members promotes a shared direction towards common goals over personal interests. This comes from: • The efforts individual team members make towards realizing team goals. • The efficiency of teamwork when team members are focused on the same goals. • The vertical trust needed to align team and organizational goals. An example question, using the same rating scale as before, is: “Our team members do not withhold information from each other.” Armed With This Information... So while there is no definitively clear evidence that any generalized and reliable methods of measuring knowledge worker productivity exist, AWA and CEBMa did find six factors that are closely associated with the performance of teams involved with knowledge work; and that can credibly act as “proxy measures.” And while none of these factors are spatial in nature, they give those of us involved in “workplace making” very valuable insights into how team performance might be positively impacted by the way space – and especially the thinking behind its allocation and the protocols for its use – can support the behaviors we’re after. For example: • the breaking down of any physical or procedural barriers to visibility or information sharing would be valuable; • as would leveraging “free address” seats to enable leaders to sit with their people and provide coaching, or to enable a related team’s member to co-locate with a team to coordinate or consult; • or placing white boards in a central location within the team to record and make visible their vision and objectives, or their milestones and work-in-progress so there’s no doubt as to what they (and others) are about; • and finally, one rationale for open plan might be to make visible the activities, trials, and tribulations of leaders so that nothing seems to be secret, and trust is engendered. These insights clearly give us even more reasons to partner with other functions within our client organizations to connect the dots between space, resources, policies and management practices, and other forms of behavioral support to enable a holistic approach to optimizing the work of the organization. At Allsteel, for example, our HR group holds what we call “two-ways” each quarter. These meetings are designed to facilitate discussions between members, leadership and managers about how we’re doing against our plan, and what initiatives are being kicked off to support a particular aspect of the plan; or to ask for more information about whatever’s on their minds. These are typically held in open areas so members can join in at any time or simply know 9 they’re happening and are not secret. HR makes note of any action items and follows up to ensure commitments are kept; and reports on the nature of the discussion to all members. We also – through both our process improvement teams and our performance management systems – coach our teams to set explicit goals and hold each other accountable. We use visual persistence to make the work of a given team visual and visible (like the example above), and invite other related teams to periodic updates on the given team’s progress. Another example is removing barriers and working to reduce behaviors that make others unwelcome in any team’s space – such that they are made to feel like outsiders. One team AWA worked with (having just introduced an agile office) found that it was now much easier to sit with other teams, find out more about what they do and generally improve relations between the teams. This would have been much harder if each team’s area was strongly demarcated and everyone had their own desk – strongly personalized and littered with files and paper – making it difficult for an outsider to feel at home and welcome. They also used their new open breakout areas to hold team meetings and invited members of other teams to attend. Holding these sessions in neutral, non team-specific space increases comfort levels and involvement. These are simple measures, but not so simple that anyone had really thought of doing them before being introduced to the importance of the six factors! Another progressive AWA client immediately extended the six factors thinking to their partners and customers. They started to think of ways in which they could improve working relationships by examining how well the factors were operating between the company and their business partners. For them, the six factors provide a new language and basis for discussing and enhancing relationships. Another AWA client proactively has their leaders sit with different groups every month to increase cohesion. All this suggests that organizations that depend heavily on the performance of their knowledge workers for business success should carry out a holistic and systematic review to test the degree to which these factors are played out in day-to-day business life. Also, they should examine the underlying culture, value structures, leadership behaviors and infrastructure their organizations have to establish how well they support the six factors. As a by-product of the research, AWA has developed two assessment tools to help organizations and teams understand the level of knowledge work they are undertaking in their roles and how well their teams are operating on the six factors. These diagnostics can be used alongside a set of guidelines for developing and improving the team’s performance, based on AWA’s experience in helping improve organizational performance. AWA recently commenced a live trial of the tools and methodology with London & Partners – the official promotional company for London. AWA’s Managing Director Andrew Mawson and Director of Research & Development Karen Plum are available to discuss the research and the tools they’ve developed. www.advanced-workplace.com or call +44 (0)20 7743 7110. ■ Portions of this paper were adapted from two other documents written by AWA and CEBMa: “The 6 Factors of Knowledge Worker Productivity”, 2015; and “Raising Office Worker Productivity”, 2014. 10 Ancona, D.G., Caldwell, D.F.

Postscript As we described at the beginning of this paper, CEBMa advocates what they call an Evidence-Based Management Approach. We thought it might be helpful to share the way they explain that in more detail. “The starting point for evidence-based management is that management decisions should be based on a combination of critical thinking and the best available evidence. By “evidence” we mean information that comes from scientific research, internal business information, and even personal experience. In principle, then, all management decisions need to be based on real “evidence” derived through a scientific process. This process not only involves knowledge of the research field and methodology, but also – and particularly – teaching students and managers how to think scientifically in order to counterbalance to subjectivity of their own judgement.” References 11 Harrison, D.A., Price, K.H., Bell, M.P., (1998) Beyond Relational Demography: Time and the Effects of Surface- and Deep-Level Diversity on Work Group Cohesion.

View all articles by Terri Seymour...
In the last twenty years the growth of online social media has been phenomenal. New social sites are popping up left and right. This social media explosion can be a powerful tool for the growth of your business. But trying to gain control of your social media skills for business development can be a daunting task. Below are some ideas on how you can zero in on your social media marketing campaign and use it to expand your online network and intensify your business. 1. Establish Identity – Starting with your username, establishing the appropriate identity is very important. Define who you are and be clear on your purpose. Do not try to be too cutesy or trendy. Trends come and go but your username will be forever. Using a good photo of yourself for your avatar is usually best. This will help brand you as a person to connect with your company. 2. Build Relationships – Establishing and building relationships is the cornerstone for all businesses. Taking the time to cement a relationship with your followers will be much more effective than being a collector of friends. Let them get to know you so trust and respect can be formed. From this will come more conversions and sales. 3. Share and Share Alike – Don’t expect everyone to share your posts and information without ever sharing back. You will need to reciprocate these actions. Let people know you appreciate the sharing of your posts, videos or information. Do not take advantage of others just to get the share. 4. Value and Quality – Do not watch conversations and then jump in when you feel your sales pitch fits. Participate in the conversation, offer sound advice and quality information. Become a regular contributor who is always willing to offer value. Don’t just copy and paste. Provide original ideas, information and resources. Take the extra time to establish your expertise and willingness to offer assistance. This will carry over into your business when the people you have helped need your services and/or products. 5. Understand Your Customers – Do your research and always be aware of your potential customers’ needs and wants. Periodically take surveys, stay on top of the marketing trends and information. There are tools that can help you compile consumer data which you can then analyze to see what is working and what is not. DataHero, NetVibes and Google Analytics are a few you can use for free to sharpen your analytical skills. 6. Analyze and Adjust – As there are tools to help you compile and analyze consumer information, there are also tools to help you track and measure your marketing responses and effectiveness. Study your engagements, likes, shares, followers, etc. to see where you can improve. Klout, HowSociable and SimplyMeasured are just some of the tools you can utilize to sharpen your social skills. 7. Focus – The number of social media sites is grown to staggering amounts. It is impossible to join them all and expect any usable results. You need to choose a few that you can excel at and spend the time and focus needed to make them work for you. My favorites are Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. I know if I attempted more, the effectiveness level would go way down. Focus your skills and concentrate them in a smaller area for more success. 8. Interactive Events – Posting and providing helpful and valuable information is a great start but you also want engagement and interaction. Holding events, contests or other such promotions can be a great way to draw interest and get the interaction you need. Hold themed contests each month. Be creative with promotions or “parties”. Games and contests are always a big business booster. Use images and videos to bring your event to life. Make it fun and exciting to people will come back for more. 9. Consistency is Key – When becoming a social pro you will need to be consistent. Stay active regularly and always respond to comments, whether positive or negative. “When you have time” unfortunately will not do the job. Social media is a full-time commitment so doing it “whenever” is a waste of time for you and your followers. 10. Separate and Distinguish – One mistake people make is to plaster the same posts over all their social sites. This is a mistake. Separate your social accounts and give each one its own identity. Distinguish what is needed for each group of followers and satisfy that need. It is hard to describe the impact that social media has had on all businesses, not just online. You may resist embracing this power because of the total feeling of being overwhelmed, but you cannot delay any longer. Get your feet wet, learn the ropes and hop on the social fast track. Getting involved in social media and expanding that network could mean a total about-face for your online business success."

"ALAB:
Think about it a little, technology has replaced brains and was intended to do so right from the outset, its merely another way of dumbing the population down and relying upon machines instead of brains.
Go back to the more subtle brain replacements, when did schools stop teaching basic maths and allow children to use calculators? now children and adults up to a certain age cannot do basic mental arithmetic and rely solely on calculators ot other electronic devices which come with calculators built in, mobile phones as an example. As you are undoubtedly aware my employer works across many fields and our designers are first rate and I wanted to bring in another younger designer to train up and our major parameter was a structural designer, he/she could then hit the ground running working mainly for the fabrication department then learn the other areas.
As an ethical company we have a huge waiting list of potential employees, we only pay slightly above average rates but profit share means they earn bonuses based on performance which obviously means more profit, they get a fixed percentage of this profit which means they earn a good whack and earn every penny of it. After advertising the position my secretary sifted through the potential candidates and they were all given a basic structural calculation to do, they were not allowed any calculators, I didn't even know what this calculation was until they all completed it. Unsurprisingly they all failed, yet I did it in my head as it was basic mental arithmetic and later I gave my youngest grandchild the formala and figures and he did it.
They all rely on a computer as modern design software incorporates the structural calculation software so they don't even have to remember formulae or be able to do mental arithmetic, they just need to dimension a structure on a drawing and click a button and it does it for them. All our current designers can do structural calculations and mental arithmetic and if they go out to site to do a client requested modification they can load the drawing onto a laptop and go to site and measure up and do an outline drawing and come back to the office and do a fully detailed drawing, he went to site and had a battery failure on his laptop, so no computer. He simply measured everything up and got his tube of A0 paper and drawing instruments from his company car, went into the site conference room and did a scale drawing on paper as we used to do it years ago. He did the structural calculations manually and when he got back to the office he ran the drawings through our huge plotter/copier and created a new file on his computer directly from his manual drawings."

Hey ... There is something I have to post about ... and of all the places for me to go ... Cally was kinda ironic in one way for me. Back up ... 5-6 years ago .. Make a long story short - Back in the day I was spending a crazy amount of money on Tour Issue stuff on another site   ... (PI$$ES ME OFF just typing it ) .... And just as that "relationship" started to degrade - I got a PM from a member here that pushed that over the edge and gave a true epiphany on just how naive I was.  THANK GOD !!! I got that PM .. Look - I'm not an idiot - but I think like a LOT of people on here and many other sites .. we WANT to believe it's different or special ... well it ain't. I got a PM from at that time - one of the top Cally fitters in the world - our member jwfgolfpro. And he basically gave the run down on where this "Tour Issue" stuff comes - with great detail on Cally product-  from and where it's really made - and why it's Tour etc ... I just sat and listened. His main motivation is that he didn't want me to have a bad feeling about his employer at that time - Callaway - and wanted me to be aware and feel good about their products cuz I was buying a TON of Cally stuff. He even offered at that point to put me on the phone with the Tour Dept if I wanted - but I got the message. The message is Tour & Retail are 1000000000% identical Last year while I at COBRA - I had their top R&D guy and COBRA PIMP DADDY virtually put in blood that they are the exact same ... etc etc etc ... SO .... Fast forward to December 13th 2012. This pic .... was taken 5 seconds before we hit Nick and Geritt with the magic question. Actually Justin beat me to the punch - cuz just as it rolled out of his mouth - I was literally about to ask it And Justin asks "OK Nick ... Seriously - Tour issue vs Retail ... Let us have it" Gang ... Nick jumped on it instantly I'm gonna paraphrase and maybe the fellas can back me up ... but this what he said in a nutshell - I remember most of it like it was yesterday Nick said "OH YEAH .... We see those topics ... The real answer is Tour Heads come in the same box - from the same manufacturer - using the same materials - built with the same process using the same glues and carbon & titanium - same specs - same cosmetics - ordered by the same people in the same orders as with all the same heads in that particular order. The ONLY !!!!!!!!!!!! reason something gets called a Tour Head - is ... either the player has asked for specific specs on a head - so they will go thru an entire box of generic stock they find "that head"  - or find a head that can be weighted or ground to what the player asked for. or they have pulled from stock - and simply measured the specs of various heads to stock their truck. That the main thing that kick a head off the truck is the CT rating as they dont want a hot head going to Tour - That would be UBER-embarrassing. It is also VERY !!!!! possible that the public will find Tour heads at the retail level as they just ended up not using them - and that if heads are not used in Tour - THEY JUST KICK THEM BACK TO RETAIL STOCK. It's just a normal operating procedure. He even said "Yeah - we kick em to retail ... They're still perfect - ready to hit - Callaway heads - Why wouldn't we??" There is ABSOLUTELY ZERO - NADA - NONE - not a SINGLE difference at all !!!!!!!!!!!! in any head in Tour or Retail. NONE !!!!!!! .. Told us POINT BLANK .. .When someone sells a heads that is Tour ... It is just a retail head with a sticker on it where the measured the specs of that head. (He even jokingly offered us stickers if it would make us feel better about the driver they were gonna build for us). He said the true "Tour Issue" piece equipment on all these heads that get sold is THE DAMN STICKER !!!!!!!!! ..... He even answered the standard sales shpeel on sellers claiming they "are insuring where CG is - so you know it's Tour Issue" .. He said that is not even remotely possible - cuz they don't weight the head until the Pro asks for it - so a true blank "Tour Issue" should be a NON-designated CG head waiting to be custom built. He did acknowledge that "prototype" is different - non-retail lofts etc / smaller ccs heads etc - but again - even those are made at the same place just to a different spec - they are still basically the same as what you buy -just different loft. Just sayin ... But I kinda believe the now TWO OEMs that have said that exact thing to me. End of lesson ... Bring on the doubt

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.
Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

Tip: On the grand final of Reno Rumble we used stringybark decking and it looked amazing. For the build of our home, we are using tallowwood decking - not only because it's Jess's favourite timber, but its durability is unbelievable. I think it will outlast us, which means I'm only going to deck our deck once.

I had it checked today and they didn't even look at the alternator -rolls eyes at the shop- I saw what they did, they simply measured my battery when the car was running, and said "It's charging fine" and when I mentioned the noises, he simply said it was probably my motor -laughs- I know another person that did alternator work on my old car and did a great job, so i'm gonna see if he can take a look at it. I remember when my alternator was making crazy noises in my last car, they tested it and said it was fine. Right, so the alternator's supposed to sound like a turbo kit? Had it rebuilt and it sounded great and worked great again. Quest - I purchased the car 2 months ago and it's been doing it since I purchased it. The cold battery readout was 12V. I wonder if using that cleaning spray would help in this situation, if it turns out the belt isn't overtightened? _________________________ 99 Pontiac Firebird - 91k - Pennzoil Platinum 5W-30/Fram Extended Guard XG3980 08 Scion tC - 112k - RP 0W-20/Fram Ultra XG4967

The distribution of traditional blade or blade-like irons on tour is simple to explain.  When players are young, they are distributed across a fairly bell-shaped, normal curve of talent.  But that normal curve of talent doesn't overlap well with the plot of their tournament performance.  When you extract equipment away from nerves, you find that all players want to play blades, but those that have a lower tournament performance metric tend to question whether they can compete at the same skill level with blades.  This group eventually experiments with, and most migrate to, game improvement irons in an effort to become more competitive with the top players of their peer group, who mostly prefer blades because their performance reinforces their own self-impression that they are at the top, and therefore should and can be playing blades.  This has always been the case in golf.  When I was a boy, you played Apex irons if you were a player.  If you could score well with Ping Eye2 irons, you were a good golfer, but you weren't a player...e.g. ball striker.  You saw this writ large out on tour during the late 80s and early 90s.  Players played blades...ball strikers....Norman, Purtzer, Price, Faldo, Strange, Woosnam, Nicklaus, Palmer, Trevino.  Guys that didn't have contracts played Mizuno blades.  You just knew deep down that skill led to blades.   Even out tour the players still size up other players on whether they have game....not whether they can score, but whether they have true, deep, enduring ball striking skills....with blades.   True top tier blade players never admired Monty's ball striking.  Playing GI irons on tour is an open, visible admission that you're scared that your skills aren't up to blades.  In my view, it's as simple as that. Over time, this process sorts these player through college into the top players that play blades, and the non-top players that have migrated over time to more forgiving equipment in an effort to compete more effectively with the top players. By the time they become professionals, there are still the group of top players that play blades (because they've always been in the top fifth, and they've never considered that the type of iron they use is holding them back), then there are top tier former blade players who switch to GI for contractual reasons and don't suffer much loss, because the type of iron head makes little difference in their tournament performance).  Then there are to other tour players that fall within the group of players that switched to GI when they were younger, and still haven't caught up, so they are now much more unlikely to switch back to blades (because in their mind, they've switched to GI and they still haven't made much progress up the ladder to the top tier, where most of the top players of note are still playing the blades they grew up with). Now, there is always going to be a small contingent of top players who never bought into the idea that top players play blades when they were young, so they used GI or SGIs and never had any reason to switch (because again, in their mind, the fact that they use GI has no bearing on their performance).  Their performance at top tier levels engrains in their mind that they can be top tier playing GI, so they see no advantage to playing blades (rationalizing, perhaps correctly, that it might only lead to worse performance, so they never switch). The performance outcomes sort all competitive players into their respective categories by the time they've been professionals for a while.  The AJGA players that develop a sense that their ball-striking and tournament results aren't at the top ( because they're not finishing in the top 10 and they're hitting the ball all over the face) will seek out GI irons to improve their performance IF they develop the idea in their head that more practice is not going to put their ball striking into the "play blades" category.  Later on, when their ball striking has only marginally improved, this reinforces that they should be GI players, and hence later, they never switch back. In other words, there are no really shabby ball strikers on tour that play blades, because the meritocracy of tournament scoring forbids it.  There are shabby ball strikers that barely survive out on tour using GI or SGI equipment.  There are top tier players using GI irons for contractual reasons, and suffer little consequence from doing so, because they are top tier ball strikers.  The poor ball strikers who prefer blades and stick with them are eventually weeded out of the pro game, since even the greatest putters have to have GIR to score.  Most of the poor ball strikers who play GI are weeded out as well, but some remain at the fringes. But if you're among those on tour that have a true, deep desire to master the game at its highest level of skill, and you actually have the skill, you have blades of one brand or another in your bag.  If you play for an OEM that specializes in GI, then they make you a one-off set.  But you have blades.   If you're a 0 or a 5 or a 10 handicap that has that same deep desire to master the game, but accepts that the skill level isn't there, you probably still play blades, because even though the perfect shots come ever so much less often, you still want that satisfaction of having done it with skill, not equipment. I want to argue that it really is not any sort of arrogance or sense of being better that drives some players to stick with blades.  It's just the enjoyment and the sense of satisfaction that comes with a well struck blade shot.  The only two iron shots that I've holed out were two 8 irons with a set of X-14 Pros that I had in the bag on and off for a while.  While they were great shots, neither had the thrill of a full blade 8 iron to inside 10 feet, where you could feel from the instant that the ball left the face that you flushed it dead center.  You knew at that instant that the ball was on the pin.  You knew that shot was a few more micrograms of chrome coming off that sweet spot, that badge of honor, that head nodding confirmation that you get when you walk on with other players you don't know and they check out your sticks. Everyone knows that a modern race car can lap a track like Mid-Ohio or the Glen much faster than an older car, but when a skilled vintage racer can pull down a lap time that would have been competitive with the car/driver back when the car was in season, there's a tremendous level of satisfaction that comes with that.  I've played with (and been beaten by) guys with new clubs and little skill, and I've beaten guys with much more skill that's just covered in rust.  One guy confuses score with skill.  The other guy isn't really about score.  Nothing is more annoying that playing with someone who has no sense of skill...who can't recognize that a ball near the hole doesn't necessarily equate to a good shot.  When I play with the rusty player, I may only say "nice shot" a few times during the round, but he knows and respects that I got it right.  With the GI or SGI golfer, you can never really say for sure...because they simply measure their shot quality by where the ball lands.  That's the only indicator they seem to have about how well they hit it.

WHAT a week!
Halloween, Melbourne Cup, staking out our build and the grand opening of the new RSL prize home right on the beach on the Gold Coast, which Jess and I helped style and create.
Yes, you read correctly - we are finally getting started on our build. After four months planning we are now ready to do our first cut into the ground, followed by 67 concrete piers and plumbing, hopefully all before Christmas.
We had hoped to also have all our footings concreted in as well to give us a great start next year, but it doesn't look like that is achieveable.
Sometimes I wish we were building on The Block or Reno Rumble as things just get done.
I don't know how our new neighbours would feel though if we worked 24 hours a day for four months. I also think we would probably double the cost. Imagine getting a quote from your tradies to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week?
That's why it was doubly important to find great tradies. Jess and I always knew we would complete our rooms each week because our tradies had our backs.
Today, we show you how to re-lay your decking - you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.
Step 1: Measure Up
We need to work out how many metres of decking you are going to need. Using a tape measure simply measure the length of your deck and multiply that by how many planks are down and that's your lineal metre (L/M).
Step 2: Prepping
This looks like a really daunting task but once you get a rhythm going, ripping up the old decking is actually quite fun. Use your hammer to tap your crowbar between the decking and your joists. (Your joists are the large timbers holding your deck up). Now using your hammer or the claw end of your crowbar, pull out all the stubborn nails that stayed in the joists. For the really tough ones you can grind them off or simply knock them in using your hammer.
Step 3: Cutting and Fixing
It is a lot easier to nail and cut as you go, especially if you're re-decking by yourself. Starting at one end place your timber down on to the joists and see where it ends. It has to end halfway over a joist so you can join the next piece. If it doesn't, using a pencil and tape, mark the centre of the next joist down. Now using a handsaw or dropsaw, cut your decking to length. Repeat this until you reach the end of your deck. Your first off-cut is now the first piece on the next run, which can be started at the opposite end from the first run. But before starting the second run, nail your first run off using a nail gun and galvanised nails. Alternatively you can hand nail - Jess and I have hand nailed our first deck and it wasn't the quickest and you could say a few barnies might have happened throughout the day. If you pre-drill all the nails it makes it a lot easier, so do yourself a favour and hire a nail gun. There are a lot of products on the market and different ways to fix your decking, such as screws or hidden fixing. However, nailing is the cheapest. Now you can start your next run. This time we are going to hold a 6mm builder's packer between the two runs of decking - this gives you your gap. Keep going until it's all covered in brand new, beautiful decking. For a better finish try and scatter your joins so they are away from each other.
Step 4: Stain
We love clear stain as the timber should be the beauty, not the stain. But if you can't source the right timber or budget is a constraint, drop in to your local hardware store and check out their samples and application of your preferred stain.

"Emojis are inescapable, especially on Instagram where the tiny icons are included in 35 percent of all brand captions.
That’s according to social analytics firm Simply Measured, which released its exhaustive yearly report about Instagram. The research, tracked the Instagram activity of 2,500 posts from 90 brands from Interbrand’s recent “Best 100” list , finds that the platform is booming for companies.
“Regardless of the industry, there’s now an interested audience on Instagram,” it wrote. Brands are finding that, on average, engagement is up 53 percent per post over last year with each post averaging 32,000 likes and comments.

Back to emojis, though. Simply Measured discovered that the heart emoji is the most engaging in the captions averaging 120,000 likes and comments — a steep increase over the sparkles emoji that averages roughly 80,000 likes and comments.
The most used emoji turns out to be the camera because it’s used for the photographer’s photo credit. The heart, registered icon and trademark logo placed in second, third and fourth place, respectively.
Hashtags, meanwhile, continue to be an integral part of Instagram behavior. The firm tallied up nearly 5,600 hashtags resulting, on average, 2.5 hashtags per brand post.
The top two hashtags were for luxury car brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz, both combined equal 9 million followers. Auto brands on Instagram resonate deeply with followers by simply showing pictures of cars because fans like looking at cars. Look no further than Honda’s growing account.
Simply Measured says the reasons why brands love emojis, besides increasingly becoming a part of our day-to-day vernacular, is because they “cut through the noise” on the increasingly popular platform."
"Summary Wal-Mart’s revenue was lower year over year, but it was significantly positive after adjusting for foreign exchange.
Comparable sales remained positive as Wal-Mart continued to bring in more customers year over year.
Operating income is down but we are seeing the most difficult quarters as Wal-Mart recognizes all of the costs associated with shifting strategies.
Wal-Mart’s future depends on growing the grocery segment.
Guidance for the rest of the year was quite reasonable even as the company handles negative foreign exchange impacts and costs of improving the workforce.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) delivered a very solid third quarter and beat on earnings even as they missed sales estimates. The earnings report was easy for investors to underestimate it they didn't look too hard. Critics point to Wal-Mart delivering a decrease in revenue year over year by 1.6%. That sounds pretty terrible, but when investors dig deeper it turns out that Wal-Mart's performance was much more bullish than bearish.
Total Revenue The challenge with simply measuring total revenue is that it severely punishes Wal-Mart for having global distribution in a period where the dollar increased dramatically in strength. The impact of converting from foreign currency to U.S. dollars resulted in what appeared to be declining sales. For critics, that is enough to suggest that the company is failing as consumers rapidly flock to alternatives. Unfortunately for the bears, that is simplistic at best.
International sales were down 11.4% year over year which sounds like a retailer that has been thoroughly smashed in international markets, however when adjusting for the impact of changes in the exchange rate the international sales would have been up 3.2% and total sales would have been up 2.8%.
When we look at the domestic market and drill in to the performance of individual stores, the company saw comparable sales increasing 1.5% with traffic up 1.7%. That indicates that sales per transaction were down slightly, but there was certainly no decrease in the number of people walking into the Wal-Mart stores. The
Operating Income The difficulty for Wal-Mart comes from declining operating income. This is something management warned shareholders about as the benefits of investing in their workforce should take time to materialize. Over time the company should see employer turnover decrease which results in a more effective workforce. In the first several quarters Wal-Mart will see weaker margins as a function of paying out higher wages to retain more talented employees, but over time it results in a better working atmosphere with more capable employees.
While shareholders would like to believe that employees are going to work as hard as possible from the first day they report to work, the reality of the situation is that a skilled workforce takes time to develop. Even though Wal-Mart designs jobs to avoid excessive complexity at any of the lower levels, there is still a material difference between the production of a fast cashier and a slow cashier. Even when it comes to stocking shelves, the fastest worker and the slowest worker will get work done at very different rates and I believe the difference in the rate of work dramatically surpasses the difference in the pay per employee. If Wal-Mart is able to make the transition to a longer tenured workforce it should lead to less employees being needed per store and superior operation.
Future Impact of Shifting Strategy On the other hand, if the ""order online and we'll load your car"" strategy picks up steam, we may see higher volumes of employees but more pricing power as picking up the groceries without entering the store is a material advantage that will encourage busy customers to prioritize Wal-Mart over stores that require more physical presence in the ""shopping"" process. As Wal-Mart rolls out the program and continues to monitor the success in sample markets they will have to make the decision about adjusting staffing levels and prices. I'd certainly be willing to pay a higher price for that service.
Someone reading this is going to think that I'm suggesting that simply by paying more for labor a company can improve their talent pool. That is precisely correct. Higher wages lead to longer tenure and better applicants as well as motivating employees to work harder. Before I worked in finance, I worked in management. Compensation impacts effort.
This has Nothing to do with Amazon Some critics will believe that somehow ""declining revenue"" is related to excessive competition from other companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). That myth should be dispelled simply by recognizing that same store sales were improving and total revenue was up materially on a constant currency basis. Regardless, there is some competition when it comes to non-food items. Wal-Mart's best performing section is their neighborhood grocery department which saw comp sales increasing by 8%. That is a fairly strong metric and the grocery department is one of the highly desirable areas for growing sales due to the margins on the grocery business and the importance of scale since products have severely limited shelf life. Wal-Mart understands that their major area of growth is being the dominant grocery store in the United States and to a lesser extent across the world.
Shifting their strategy to incorporate higher wages and a higher standard of service for customers reflects a keen understanding of the importance of dominating the grocery segment. Allowing customers to shop online and pick up groceries in person is excellent for driving growth as the company is able to track consumer buying habits significantly better. It also allows them to do a better job of reducing their waste of food products. There are significant impacts from customers assuming that the last vegetable or fruit must be fundamentally flawed. There are issues with consumers searching for the freshest loaf of bread or gallon of milk that result in products becoming substantially more difficult to sell as soon as the shelf is restocked. By shifting to selling products online Wal-Mart should see gains in their operations on the grocery side from a material reduction in the rate of spoilage. Leveraging this ability gives Wal-Mart a solid way to reinforce their role as a low cost leader.
Guidance Management provided guidance for the fourth quarter which includes earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.55, compared to $1.53 last year. Yes, the average of this range would suggest a reduction in EPS but this is during one of the most costly periods in the transition to a higher service business with longer tenured employees. Over the next year I think Wal-Mart report their weakest earnings of the next decade. While the temporary reduction in earnings may seem painful, this will pass. Shareholders can console themselves with bargain bin prices on one of the greatest dividend champions in the market."

"The Most Common Misconceptions Harbored by Instagram Users by Admin · December 26, 2015
Among the fastest growing social networks on the cyberspace, Instagram ranks very well, having amassed over 400 million users in just a few years. It combines the ease of a simple scroll-and-click app with the entire social experience, and works absolutely fantastically. The app is visual media-centric; it focuses solely on pictures and videos. Users are presented with a host of filters and other editing options to edit the image before publishing it.
This simple-enough premise has now formed the backbone of millions of marketing firms, artists, photographers, travelers and celebrities’ social lives. However, there are certain fallacious inhibitions and ideas which arise in users’ minds, which hold them back from using the app to its full potential. These misconceptions, once cleared, will allow you to make the most of Instagram and understand its true power. Image Source: Google image
Just another Network?
Possibly the worst mistake a digital marketer could make is to consider Instagram to be just another social option which they need not include in their strategy, as they have already launched Facebook and(or) Twitter campaigns. This is a cardinal mistake, as a well-planned and well-implemented Instagram promotion strategy could in fact bring you dividends much faster than other platforms. Features like hashtags and @ mentions boost brand visibility, and look very appealing thanks to shared visual aids.
Only Visual Products Work on Instagram
Yet another wrong line of thought. While Instagram is designed to be a visual medium, it doesn’t mean that only funky, flashy or visual products can be promoted there. This just poses a creative challenge to the advertising department of your firm, as to how they can highlight the products or services that you offer. If you’re hiring, it’s a great idea to post pictures of your workspace, your teams and employees to show potential applicants the sort of work ethic and atmosphere you offer.
It is Impossible to Track or Manage the Success of Instagram Campaigns
This too is completely wrong. While Instagram doesn’t come with built-in advanced metrics for the sake of simplicity, there are multiple applications and services designed specifically for this exact purpose, like SumAll, Iconosquare, Simply Measured and Nitrogram. Furthermore, you can automate and increase the productivity of your business’ Instagram account by using a service called IFTTT.
Instagram Isn’t Interactive
On the contrary, it is a highly interactive medium. While you may think that the strict only picture or video rule holds you back, the truth is that it only opens newer avenues for you to explore, like creating a new hashtag campaign for your company or a product line, or asking customers to post their pictures using your new product. This active marketing strategy goes a long way in attracting fans and also shows how much you care about them.
Instagram Is Only for the Big Boys
A lot of companies are apprehensive or reluctant to launch a marketing campaign on Instagram because they think that only the big, established companies can be successful in this sort of a campaign. This is completely untrue, as proven by several startups over the years. All you need is a product or service, a USP, and the creative ability and passion to market it. With some referrals and a good deal of dedication, you’ll be able to get followers on Instagram and have your profile up and running in no time.
Instagram Is Only Effective If You Have Tons of Followers
Again, this is a very unhealthy approach to social marketing and does not hold true for any network, definitely not Instagram. You should focus more about the quality of the posts themselves and the community that you intend to build. If you have five thousand dedicated, faithful followers, you’re actually doing a better job than a competitor who has ten thousand followers who may have just clicked the “follow” button casually or as a favor.
Now that most of the common errors in judgment have been clarified, you can click away and go back to enjoying Instagram!

Open Access This  //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/   Abstract Background Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is maturing from its early focus on epidemiology to embrace a wider range of disciplines and methodologies. At the heart of EBM is the patient, whose informed choices have long been recognised as paramount. However, good evidence-based care is more than choices. Discussion We discuss six potential ‘biases’ in EBM that may inadvertently devalue the patient and carer agenda: limited patient input to research design, low status given to experience in the hierarchy of evidence, a tendency to conflate patient-centred consulting with use of decision tools; insufficient attention to power imbalances that suppress the patient’s voice, over-emphasis on the clinical consultation, and focus on people who seek and obtain care (rather than the hidden denominator of those that do not seek or cannot access care). Summary To reduce these ‘biases’, EBM should embrace patient involvement in research, make more systematic use of individual (‘personally significant’) evidence, take a more interdisciplinary and humanistic view of consultations, address unequal power dynamics in healthcare encounters, support patient communities, and address the inverse care law. Background All authors have research experience and academic qualifications, but we are patients and carers as well (see ‘Details of Contributors’ below). Some of us were patients and carers first, then became academics; some were established academics before illness led us to reframe our perspective on evidence-based medicine (EBM). Incorporating the patient’s perspective in EBM is sometimes conflated with ascertaining his or her preferences and sharing decisions about possible tests and treatments. These are important elements of good practice (covered in separate papers in this series [ 1 ], [ 2 ]), but they comprise a small fraction of what healthcare is [ 3 ], [ 4 ]. Furthermore, whilst we applaud the EBM community’s rapidly emerging interest in the patient perspective, we are concerned that a narrow, doctor-defined ‘patient’s agenda’ – epidemiologically-based and focused on a set of choices to be made during the medical encounter – is being imposed, with the best of intentions, on people who live with illness. An ‘evidence-based’ healthcare decision is inevitably informed by the stages of evidence creation. First, some people – traditionally researchers and/or doctors, but increasingly with patient and carer input – decide which outcomes count. Next, research is undertaken to find out how to best achieve the designated outcomes. Results are published and, later on, a clinician interprets and shares them in the clinical encounter. The patient in the above scenario begins from a different place. Even when patients are ‘informed’, ‘empowered’, and ‘health-literate’ (and especially when they are not), they rarely inhabit a world of controlled experiments, abstracted variables, objective measurement of pre-defined outcomes, average results, or generalizable truths. Rather, they live in the messy, idiosyncratic, and unpredictable world of a particular person in a particular family context (or, for some, in a context of social isolation and/or abandonment by family) [ 5 ], [ 6 ]. Notwithstanding this, patients may seek out medical information and self-monitor biometric variables, with or without the knowledge or support of their clinician [ 7 ]. A patient’s symptoms and measurements, along with the implications, factors at stake, and potential trade-offs of different management options, are likely to be discussed with family, friends, and peers [ 8 ]. The clinical encounter, whether patient-initiated (e.g. to present a symptom or concern) or clinician-initiated (e.g. an invitation for screening or chronic disease surveillance), has cultural and moral significance and occurs against a complex backdrop of personal sense making, information seeking, and lay consultations [ 9 ]–[ 11 ]. The options tabled by the clinician for a ‘shared decision’ may or may not resonate with what has occurred in the patient’s world up to this point. Furthermore, following a (more or less) shared decision, the patient goes away and re-enters what has been termed the ‘lifeworld’ [ 12 ] – a world where people rather than biomedical variables have salience and where it is particularities, not mean values or generalizable truths, that matter [ 13 ]. In this world, different factors will be at stake; the illness as lived will differ from the disease or risk state in the evidence-based guideline, and may well be at odds with the outcomes (whether ‘patient reported’ or not) measured in the research trial [ 14 ]. With the help of particular carers, family, friends, and peers (whether defined as ‘carers’ or not), the patient tries to align the evidence-based model of disease with the actual experience of illness or (assigned) risk. Below, we discuss six features of EBM – which we refer to, figuratively, as ‘biases’ – that may inadvertently devalue this broader patient and carer agenda: (1) the lack of patient input to the research process; (2) the low status given to experience (‘anecdote’) in the hierarchy of evidence; (3) EBM’s tendency to conflate patient-centred care with use of shared decision-making tools; (4) the limited attention given in EBM to power imbalances that suppress the patient’s voice; (5) EBM’s over-emphasis on the clinician-patient dyad (overlooking the ongoing work of self-management and the importance of the patient’s wider social networks, both on and offline); and (6) EBM’s primary focus on people who seek and obtain care (rather than on the hidden denominator of those that do not seek or cannot access care). These influences, and their potential effects on the process and outcome of evidence-based care, are summarised in Table 1 . We consider them in turn below.
Table 1. ‘Biases’ against patients and carers in traditional evidence-based medicine (EBM) and how they might be overcome Note that whilst all the ‘biases’ below are evident in the EBM literature, we are not suggesting that practitioners, researchers, or teachers of EBM are, as individuals, biased (that is, prejudiced) against patients or carers. On the contrary, many protagonists of EBM are passionately committed to working in a patient-centred way. Our argument is that despite the best intentions of these individuals, EBM’s paradigmatic assumptions, theories, tools, and techniques, as well as its existing evidence base, contain potential distortions that may have negative consequences for the people it aims to serve. In short, it is the paradigm that contains the biases highlighted below, not (in general) the people who seek to develop or apply it. We hope that practitioners, teachers, and researchers of EBM will ask themselves when reading each of the biases below: “Given that I personally seek to be unbiased in relation to patients and carers, how should I alter my use of evidence/teaching approach/research focus to help redress this bias?” Discussion Bias 1: Most published research has had minimal patient input Evidence generated by clinical research will depend on who asks the questions, who defines the outcome measures, who interprets the findings, and who disseminates the outputs. In the past few years, many research funders have encouraged patient input to each of these steps [ 15 ]. However, it will be decades before this laudable stance achieves the necessary change in the knowledge base so that it truly reflects patients’ priorities and needs. Most studies underpinning today’s evidence-based decisions were designed in an era when researchers were assumed to know better than patients which interventions should be compared, which outcomes should be measured (and when), what the data meant, and who should be informed of the results. In the widely cited Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), for example, conducted between 1983 and 1993, people with type 1 diabetes were randomised to ‘intensive’ or ‘conventional’ treatment and followed-up long term to assess the risk of complications [ 16 ]. Whilst intensive treatment was associated with a lower incidence of microvascular complications (including the presence of asymptomatic microalbuminuria, a surrogate endpoint that clearly mattered to the researchers), it tripled the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia – a complication classified as ‘minor’ by the researchers since it was not, on average, associated with cognitive decline or lower quality of life. Indeed, the only kind of hypoglycaemic attack counted as a problem in the DCCT was one “ in which [medical] assistance was required in the provision of treatment ” [ 16 ]. When the DCCT was set up, people with diabetes were not invited to help design or oversee it (reflecting prevailing research practice at the time). Those who have experienced hypoglycaemic episodes may have different views on how necessary it is to avoid such experiences. One problem with frequent hypoglycaemic episodes is (possibly permanent) loss of awareness of impending hypoglycaemia – a phenomenon that people with type 1 diabetes consider important and dangerous [ 17 ]. The DCCT researchers’ conclusion – that a policy of tight diabetes control should be routinely pursued – was based largely on their own value-judgement that delay of microvascular complications was worth the trade-off of a substantial increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks severe enough to impair consciousness. After cataloguing the comas, seizures, and fatal motor accidents caused by hypoglycaemia in the study, they concluded: “ Although we are mindful of the potential for severe injury, we believe that the risk of severe hypoglycaemia… is greatly outweighed by the reduction in microvascular and neurologic complications ” ([ 16 ], p. 983). A similar conclusion was drawn about tight control of type 2 diabetes based on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, conducted between 1977 and 1997 [ 18 ]. Participants, newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, were randomised to tight or conventional glycaemic control. Tight control (achieved with insulin or oral medication) was associated with a 12 % lower risk of what the trial authors called “ any diabetes-related endpoint ” (that is, clinical end-points predefined by the researchers) and a 25 % lower risk of microvascular complications (including microalbuminuria). Tight control with insulin was associated with a significant increase in both weight gain and hypoglycaemic episodes. Again, patients were not formally consulted either when designing the trial or when interpreting findings. The study’s authors and journal editors interpreted the findings to support a policy of tight glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes [ 19 ]. The questionable evidence from DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes Study directly informed the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework, a pay-for-performance scheme in which general practitioners were financially incentivised to monitor and manage diabetes and other conditions in a stipulated way [ 20 ]. The Quality and Outcomes Framework target introduced in 2008 (an HbA1c of below 7.0 %) reflected what policymakers deemed the evidence base for tight glycaemic control from these early trials (and which others have dubbed ‘the idolatry of the surrogate’ [ 21 ]). It ignored more recent evidence from the larger ACCORD trial, which showed little (if any) benefit from tight versus conventional control and an increase in mortality with the former [ 22 ], [ 23 ]. As a result, many people with diabetes were treated aggressively by doctors whose personal income depended on achieving outdated and dangerous biomarker target levels [ 24 ], increasing the risk of recurrent hypoglycaemia and its associated hard-to-capture impacts on quality of life. Whilst the target was revised a few years later to 7.5 % by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [ 25 ], it is possible (though by no means certain) that attention to patient priorities at the time the DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes Study trials were designed, executed, and interpreted might have prevented this potentially harmful policy being introduced. The transition from ‘outcomes that matter to researchers’ to ‘outcomes that matter to patients’ has fuelled (and been fuelled by) the rapidly expanding science of patient-reported outcome measures – standardised instruments developed via systematic surveys of people who have the condition being researched [ 26 ]. Factoring in the patient perspective in trial design is an important step forward. Nevertheless, patient-reported outcome measures and similar instruments – which effectively give us patients’ priorities ‘on average’ – can never fully capture the situated, fluctuating granularity of what matters most to a particular patient and carer at a particular point in the illness journey (including why the person has or has not consulted the clinician at a key decision point). We consider this agenda in the next few sections. Bias 2: EBM’s hierarchy of evidence devalues the individual patient experience Standardised measures of patient priorities are less relevant when dealing with individuals. If we want to tailor an evidence-based decision to a particular patient’s priorities and circumstances, we need data that are personally significant in the here and now – and for this we need the richness of narrative. The individual case report sits at the bottom of EBM’s hierarchy of evidence. Indeed, we are explicitly warned not to trust ‘anecdotal’ evidence [ 27 ]. This is entirely appropriate if the question being asked is “should I rely on a story of what happened to some other patient when advising this patient?” However, the warning is misplaced – harmful even – if the question is “what do I know about this patient that will help me work with him or her to refine and personalise a management plan?” The latter question demands that statistically significant evidence from research trials is interpreted and applied with an understanding of the personally significant evidence of the patient’s own experience. Personally significant evidence includes both objective evidence (e.g. what this patient’s test results show), and subjective evidence (e.g. what this patient feels; what matters to him or her) [ 28 ]. For example, if I have taken my daily statin on thousands of occasions without developing muscle pains, and if my blood tests show no rise in marker enzyme levels, the chance that I will develop muscle pains on the same statin tomorrow is much less than the published incidence of myalgia on this drug, based on the mean incidence measured in thousands of patients in post-marketing surveillance studies. Clearly, judgement is needed when deciding how much weight to give personally significant evidence compared to statistically significant evidence derived from a distant population sample. EBM is defined in the literature as the science of integrating the clinician’s expertise and judgement with best research evidence and the individual detail of the patient’s case [ 29 ]. It emerged partly as a reaction to widespread inconsistencies in clinical decision-making (such as managing one patient on the basis of what happened to the previous patient) – and has been very successful in improving outcomes. However, whilst the science of ‘best research evidence’ has moved on substantially, the EBM literature has paid much less attention to the science (and art) of how to capture the subjectivity, uniqueness, and real-world messiness of the individual case and how to integrate it with research data to aid decision-making. Similarly, many people in the EBM community acknowledge that qualitative research to describe the patient experience, including the perspective of carers and significant others, can add granularity and meaning to research findings consisting of effect sizes, confidence intervals, and grand means. Nevertheless, they also tend to retain a hierarchical view of the value of such research, viewing qualitative evidence as less robust than quantitative evidence, rather than complementary to it and addressing different questions. Not all individual patient experiences are research data, of course [ 30 ]. However, systematically collected narratives, along with phenomenological and ethnographic evidence (studies of the lived experience of illness and healthcare), provide essential counterweight to the epidemiologically oriented framings and categorisations of EBM. Findings from such research include that: The EBM literature tends to depict the patient’s illness as a fixed entity with more or less stable properties; it often portrays the patient as feeling the same about their condition tomorrow as they do today. In reality, symptoms of chronic illness can fluctuate substantially from day to day, as does the significance a person places on the illness [ 31 ]–[ 33 ]. Being ill is a tiny part of what it means to live with a long-term condition (especially one that is largely asymptomatic). Most of the time, it is the living that is foregrounded, not the illness [ 29 ]. The EBM literature tends to depict a long-term condition as deviation from an assigned ‘normal state’ (measured by biomarkers) and as periodic ‘illness exacerbations’ that prompt the patient to seek care. The patient’s experience of the same condition may not be as an illness at all but as a dimension of being, a fact of life, and something that must be attended to and ‘tinkered with’ [ 31 ], [ 34 ], [ 35 ]. Much of the EBM literature relies on (and its practitioners must to some extent accept) fixed categories and definitions of what a disease is. Qualitative research can inform new categories and definitions if researchers are open to this possibility. Patients with depression, for example, who took selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, were ignored for years after they raised concerns about side effects such as ‘electric head feeling’ that did not fit the existing ‘evidence-based’ model of the drug’s effects or the formal categories of adverse events used in standardised post-marketing surveillance [ 36 ]. Bias 3: EBM conflates patient-centredness with use of shared decision-making tools Few people think of their illness(es) as a series of discrete decision nodes. Being presented with a menu of options, each tagged with a probability, odds ratio, number needed to treat, or number needed to harm (even when the last two are expressed visually as so many happy or sad faces, respectively) can be problematic, even for those who do. Option grids and other ‘tools to support conversations’ represent significant progress in the shared decision-making field, but remain little used [ 1 ], [ 37 ]. One reason for the limited success of decision aids is that the patient is not a dispassionate information processer. In contrast to the autonomous rational chooser assumed in EBM’s decision trees, we make many of our life choices for reasons other than effectiveness or efficiency – for example, because we think a particular option would fit in with family plans, align with cultural expectations of good parenting, or honour the memory of an ancestor [ 3 ]–[ 5 ]. Unless these reasons are recognised as primary drivers of human behaviour, clinician and patient will be at cross-purposes. Communication is only partly about sharing information and agreeing a management plan; it also involves talk and gestures to establish and strengthen a therapeutic relationship [ 38 ]. The therapeutic relationship is central, not marginal, to evidence-based practice. The stronger it is, the greater the chance that there will be a mutually agreed management plan, the more comfortable the patient will be carrying out their part in the plan and the more satisfied both parties will be [ 39 ], [ 40 ]. There is strong and consistent evidence that the success of the evidence-based consultation depends on its humanistic elements as much as on what information is shared and how. It is nearly 30 years since family medicine introduced the ‘patient centred clinical method’ [ 41 ], [ 42 ], summarized in a recent review as: “ the adoption of a biopsychosocial [incorporating EBM, psychology and attention to social context] perspective by providers; the sharing of decisions and responsibilities between patients and providers; the strengthening of practitioners’ compassion, sensitivity to patients’ distress and commitment to respond to patients with empathy in an effort to alleviate suffering .” [ 43 ]. As Miles and Mezzich have observed [ 44 ], there is remarkably little overlap between the EBM movement (oriented to objective, scientific, and often mathematical management of disease and risk) and the movement for patient-centred care (“ the … imperative to care, comfort and console as well as to ameliorate, attenuate and cure ”). The time is well overdue for these two important streams of scholarship in clinical method to explore their differences and establish common ground. Bias 4: Power imbalances can suppress the patient’s voice Healthcare interactions are characterised by socially prescribed roles and by imbalances of power and status that profoundly affect how each party behaves [ 9 ]. In the medical consultation, for example, the doctor has higher status, greater familiarity with the system, (usually) greater knowledge of disease process, and more extensive access to further information and resources. The doctor also typically controls the agenda and the use of time; he or she selects the language used to define and record the problem (and decides whether the patient’s account is sufficiently important and credible to be worth recording at all). The doctor can ask the patient to remove clothing and reveal intimate and embarrassing aspects of their body or mind, and ask a valued carer to leave the room for reasons of ‘confidentiality’. Whilst a clinician’s use of power may be appropriate and inevitable (to the extent, for example, that when we are sick, our capacity is impaired and we want to be looked after and for highly-trained professionals to make decisions on our behalf [ 45 ]), they can sometimes distort interaction in a way that disadvantages the patient – especially when the doctor is under time pressure and/or not behaving altruistically [ 46 ], when doctor and patient are from different social classes or speak different languages [ 47 ], or when the patient’s complaint fits poorly with the biomedical model of disease [ 48 ], [ 49 ]. There may be no truly democratising solution to this ‘bias’, since illness makes us vulnerable, doctors are (at least in theory) experts on the condition being treated, and the goal of equal power-sharing may turn out to be (as one reviewer of an earlier draft of this paper put it) a “ race to the bottom ”. However, even when patients have greater knowledge about their condition than the doctor treating them, the power dynamic is such that the doctor’s (in this example, weaker) evidence tends to trump the patient’s (in this example, stronger) evidence – and the former may succeed in defining the latter as ‘non-compliant’ [ 10 ], [ 50 ]. In one qualitative study of people with type 1 diabetes, although specialist doctors supported “ participatory decision making ” and empowerment of patients, they frequently discounted patients’ experiential knowledge and withheld resources that would allow patients to make truly informed decisions [ 51 ]. Examples from these studies included doctors dismissing symptoms that were not explained by blood tests, ignoring patient experience that did not correspond to textbook descriptions, using medical jargon to re-establish a position of power, and actively withholding information or services. Patients learnt to conceal their own expertise and treatment decisions in order to comply with medical expectations and to avoid professionals becoming “ patronizing or angry ” [ 50 ], [ 51 ]. All these might be considered as examples of what has been called ‘epistemic injustice’ – that is, the numerous and often subtle ways in which patients may be dismissed in their specific capacity as knowers [ 52 ]. Power imbalances between clinicians and patients are particularly stark in the mental health field, where the doctor has the power (in consultation with other professionals) to declare the patient as ‘lacking mental capacity’, incarcerate him or her, and impose treatment. The mental health literature contains troubling examples of people who consider themselves to have been dehumanised in the name of evidence-based practice and who now describe themselves as a ‘survivor movement’ (that is, those who have survived medical interventions that did them alleged harm) [ 53 ], [ 54 ]. For all these reasons, those who seek to make consultations ‘evidence based’ need to pay more nuanced attention to the power dynamics in these interactions. Measures, such as allocating more time to the consultation, using advocates and mediators, encouraging patients to bring lists of concerns, explicitly recognising and addressing the differing needs of disadvantaged groups and visiting vulnerable patients in their homes, and encouraging patients to bring a carer or advocate into the consultation if they wish, for example, are all evidence-based ways to reduce the power imbalance in the patient’s favour [ 55 ]–[ 61 ]. A reviewer of a previous draft of this paper pointed out that the power imbalances described in this section may also play out when patients and carers are invited to be involved in research. Offering lay people the opportunity to help design studies and challenge researchers’ assumptions and perspectives may not always translate into democratic partnerships, especially in situations where power-knowledge imbalances are prominent. Bias 5: EBM over-emphasises the clinical consultation Shared decision-making is strongly emphasised in EBM, but this focus assumes that the key interactions occur between a patient and a clinician around a medical decision tree. This depiction is flawed on a number of fronts. First, we are highly social and mutually dependent beings. Our interactions with medicine often involve others (who may be present or absent during the consultation) [ 62 ], [ 63 ]. Managing a chronic illness involves work, which is typically distributed across a network of family and friends [ 3 ], [ 8 ], [ 31 ], [ 64 ]–[ 66 ]. Doctors generally know this, but their ‘evidence-based’ discussions with patients about the options for tests and treatments rarely take full account of which people and perspectives the patient would like to bring into the conversation, when, and how; this is of more than tangential significance. Older couples, for example, may be managing various conditions and other life problems concurrently, and may develop a hierarchy of priority. In such circumstances, ‘being ill’ becomes a negotiated position depending on one’s responsibilities and commitments to others [ 3 ], [ 64 ]. Second, the overwhelming majority of decisions about a person’s chronic condition are made by that individual, their carer(s), and their lay networks without the input of professionals [ 10 ], [ 67 ]. The knowledge of how to manage one’s own illness overlaps only partially with the knowledge that doctors draw on to manage diseases; it also includes the embodied, tacit knowledge of particular symptoms and the body’s response to treatment [ 3 ], [ 68 ]. Some decisions (such as which drug to take, if any) may be best shared with one’s clinician; others (such as how to tell one’s employer about illness or how to cope emotionally with stigma) may be better shared with friends or fellow patients. Tacit knowledge is the stuff of communities of practice – accumulated through years of experience and exchanged through stories [ 69 ]–[ 71 ]. A particularly revealing genre of patient narrative is doctors’ stories of their own illness journeys – in which they reveal how little they knew about their condition before experiencing it themselves, and how much they learned, often slowly and tangentially, from hearing or reading stories from other patients [ 72 ]–[ 75 ]. Mutual support and knowledge exchange among people with long-term conditions is not a new phenomenon, but its form is changing. Old-style patient support groups that met periodically in a local venue, perhaps supported by national or local charities [ 76 ], [ 77 ], have been joined by virtual peer support groups (e.g. on Facebook, Twitter, or bespoke online communities that may be supported by the healthcare service provider) [ 78 ], [ 79 ]. Members value knowledge exchange (both explicit and tacit) as well as practical tips and emotional support [ 80 ]–[ 83 ]. Tacit knowledge (personally embodied, socially shared) is captured poorly if at all in the design of the clinical trials underpinning EBM, which focus predominantly on discrete ‘interventions’ that doctors and other health professionals can offer their patients (drugs, operations, specialist technologies, education). Herein lies a paradox: clinician-researchers are building an experimental science of how they can intervene in patients’ illnesses [ 84 ], while patients themselves are building collaborative communities aimed at supporting and informing one another [ 80 ]–[ 83 ]. Hence, EBM’s accumulating body of (explicit, research-based) knowledge and the (informal, tacit, and socially shared) knowledge actually being used by people managing their condition are developing separately rather than in dialogue with one another. Lay networks and online support groups emerge and change organically. They are complex systems that cannot be experimented on or ‘controlled for’ [ 85 ], [ 86 ]. They exchange the kind of knowledge that is (by definition) hard to define or quantify. As such, they cannot be understood purely through the kind of research designs with which the majority of the EBM community is familiar. Yet, if it is to remain relevant, EBM must engage with these communities and, to do so, EBM scholars must learn a new language and methodology – that of the social science of networks and digital communities [ 87 ], [ 88 ]. Bias 6: EBM is concerned mainly with people who seek care The EBM process is classically depicted as starting when the patient presents to the health service and the practitioner is encouraged to ‘ask a focused question’. The reality for many sick or at-risk individuals is that getting to see a health professional is a significant hurdle – or else an option that, for whatever reason, they have not yet come to contemplate. As a result of this ‘hidden denominator’ of people who do not seek or cannot access care, clinic populations will be unrepresentative and findings from research on these populations will be systematically biased. As Hart argued decades ago in his paper ‘ The Inverse Care Law ’, because of the distorting and mutually reinforcing impact of the social determinants of health (such as poverty, low health literacy, social exclusion, and so on), and the limiting impact of illness itself on people’s physical and mental capacity, individuals most in need of healthcare are least likely to seek it or receive it [ 89 ]. It is no coincidence, for example, that the recent Confidential Inquiry into Premature Deaths of People with Learning Difficulties in the UK attributed many such deaths to complex interactions between physical, cognitive, and social factors, including, in many cases, not being able to access the care needed to prevent an otherwise avoidable death [ 65 ]. Through ignorance, stereotyping, or cognitive biases, doctors may fail to recognise general medical or surgical conditions in someone who is known to the system as a ‘mental health’ or ‘learning disabled’ patient [ 90 ]–[ 92 ]. A recent BMJ series has highlighted the crucial importance of ‘mundane’ design features of hospitals such a"

"What Does FICO Stand for? The question can be answered by looking at the company behind those ubiquitous credit scores. Chuck Saletta Oct 10, 2015 at 9:02AM Image source: Pixabay.com.
Have you wondered exactly what ""FICO"" stands for? You've likely heard that having a good FICO score is important when it comes to borrowing money, but as an acronym, the meaning behind ""FICO"" itself is not all that obvious.
FICO simply stands for F air I saac & Co mpany (NYSE: FICO) , the company behind those ubiquitous scores. FICO scores are provided to about 90% of the top lenders for use in their decisions on whom to lend to, how much, and at what interest rate.
What does FICO stand for in your life? If you've ever borrowed money or applied for credit, chances are that FICO played a big role in the process -- and what you paid for the privilege of borrowing money. Even if you didn't deal with FICO directly, your lender likely did. And based in part on the FICO score you had on the day you applied for your loan, that lender set the terms for your loan.
The higher your FICO score, the better the terms you get. For instance, the largest loan most people get is their mortgage. Fannie Mae, one of the government-sponsored enterprises that buys most mortgages, publishes a ""Loan Level Price Adjustment Matrix"" that determines how much of a premium you pay on your mortgage based on your FICO score and your loan-to-value ratio on your house. The chart below shows the base level of that Fannie Mae matrix: Source: Fannie Mae.
The higher on that credit chart you are, the lower the adjustment Fannie Mae requires to buy your loan, which in turn reduces the interest rate you pay. And notice the footnote at the bottom: It indicates that Fannie Mae doesn't generally accept mortgages from borrowers with a credit score below 620.
While other lenders may not publicly post the impact that your FICO score has on their lending decisions, chances are really good that your score matters in how they treat you, too. Your credit card company might use your FICO score in deciding how to adjust your interest rate when it changes its terms, or in choosing whether to issue you a credit limit increase. Your auto lender might use it to figure out whether you qualify for its advertised ultra-low-interest rate financing.
In addition to the effects your FICO score can have on your ability to borrow money, it also can impact things like your car insurance rates. And while FICO scores themselves aren't generally used in employment decisions, the information in your credit report -- much the same information used to create that FICO score -- can be used to influence decisions on who gets some jobs, too.
Can you improve your FICO score? Given your FICO score's importance in things as varied as your employment, your insurance, and your ability to borrow money, it's one number you've got good reason to want to improve. Fortunately, it is possible to improve a bad FICO score over time. The keys to improving it are straightforward: Pay your debts on time and as agreed. Pay off (but continue to use) your credit cards, and don't charge your accounts to anywhere near their limits. Only open new accounts if necessary, and keep your older credit card accounts open. Check your credit report, and challenge any inaccurate information on it. Give it time. Once resolved, accurate negative information will eventually age off your record.
Beware of credit repair scams that promise to get rid of legitimate bad information, often charging you hefty amounts for the service. Chances are that if you follow their ""advice,"" you're setting yourself up to get your own identity stolen or wind up in jail for misrepresenting yourself on a loan request. You've probably seen ads from companies promising a ""new credit identity"" — that is, a fresh start for your credit history. It may seem like just the thing you need to get your credit back on track, but it's actually a scam. These companies often sell Social Security numbers illegally. If you use a number other than your own to apply for credit, not only won't you get credit, but you also could face fines or prison.
Anything a legal credit counseling service can do for you, you could likely do for yourself for free, and if someone is promising you something that sounds too good to be true, walk away. Chances are that any ""help"" they could offer you would either be very short-lived or cost you even more in the end.
Don't let your FICO score control your financial life As important as your FICO score may seem, in the end, it simply measures how well you pay back money that you borrow. Having a decent handle on your borrowing is an important foundation, but it's not the be-all and end-all of your financial life.
Once you're in control of your debts and have started building your nest egg through saving and investing, you'll likely find that your FICO score will matter less to you. That even holds true if your score climbs to the levels where you could get the best terms on your loans. Indeed, if you treat being responsible with your debts as part of your overall financial plan rather than simply striving for the highest possible FICO score, you'll put yourself on a path to a better long-term financial future.
The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: One easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

"Dan Kahan Posted on Monday, November 9, 2015 at 9:01AM
It never fails! My own best efforts ( here & here ) to explain the startling and increasingly notorious paper by Miller & Sanjuro have prompted the authors to step forward and try to restore the usual state of perfect comprehension enjoyed by the 14.3 billion regular readers of this blog. They have determined, in fact, that it will take three separate guest posts to undo the confusion, so apparently I've carried out my plan to a [GV]T.
As cool as the result of the M&S paper is, I myself remain fascinated by what it tells us about cognition, particularly among those with exquisitely fine-tuned statistical intuitions. How did the analytical error they uncovered in the classic ""hot hand fallacy"" studies remain undetected for some thirty years, and why does it continue to provoke stubborn resistance on the part of very very smart people. To Miller & Sanjuro's credit, they have happily and persistently shouldered the immense burden of explication necessary to break the grip of the pesky intuition that their result ""just can't be right!""
Thanks for the invitation to post here Dan!
Here’s our plan for the upcoming 3 posts: Today’s plan: A bit of the history of the hot hand fallacy, then clearly stating the bias we find, explaining why it invalidates the main conclusion of the original hot hand fallacy study (1985), and further, showing that correcting for the bias flips the conclusion of the original data, so that it now can be used as evidence supporting the existence of meaningfully large hot hand shooting. Next post: Provide a deeper understanding of how the bias emerges. Final post: Go deeper into potential implications for research on the hot hand effect, hot hand beliefs, and the gambler’s fallacy.
Part I
In the seminal hot hand fallacy paper , Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky (1985; “GVT”, also see the 1989 Tversky & Gilovich “Cold Facts” summary paper ) set out to conduct a truly informative scientific test of hot hand shooting. After studying two types of in game shooting data, they conducted a controlled shooting study (experiment) with the Cornell University men’s and women’s basketball teams. This was an effective ""...method for eliminating the effects of shot selection and defensive pressure"" that were present as confounds in their analysis of game data (we will return to the issue of game data in a follow up post; for now click to the first page of Dixit & Nalebuff’s 1991 classic book “Thinking Strategically”, and this comment on Andrew Gelman’s blog). While the common use of the term “hot hand” shooting is vague and complex, everybody agrees that it refers to a temporary elevation in a player’s ability, i.e. the probability of a successful shot. Because hot state is unobservable to the researcher (perhaps not the player/teammate/coach!) , we cannot simply measure a player’s probability of success in the hot state; we need an operational definition. A natural idea is to take a streak of sufficient length as a good signal of whether or not a player is in the hot state, and define a player as having the hot hand if his/her probability of success is greater after a streak of successful shots (hits), than after a streak of unsuccessful shots (misses). GVT designed a test for this.
Adam Sanjurjo enjoying snacks in green room before Oprah Winfrey show appearance Suppose we wanted to test whether Stephen Curry has the hot hand; how would we apply GVT’s test to Curry? The answer is that we would have Curry attempt 100 shots at locations from which he is expected to have a 50% chance of success (like a coin). Next, we would calculate Curry’s field goal percentage on those shots that immediately follow a streak of successful shots (hits), and test whether it is bigger than his field goal percentage on those shots that immediately follow a streak of unsuccessful shots (misses); the larger the difference that we observe, the stronger the evidence of the hot hand. GVT performed this test on the Cornell players, and found that this difference in field goal percentages was statistically significant for only one of the 26 players (two sample t-test), which is consistent with the chance variation that the coin model predicts.
Now, one can ask oneself: if Stephen Curry doesn’t get hot, that is, for each of his 100 shot attempts he has exactly a 50% chance of hitting his next shot, then what would I expect his field goal percentage to be when he is on a streak of three (or more) hits? Similarly, what would I expect his field goal percentage to be when he is on a streak of three (or more) misses?
Following GVT’s analysis, one can form two groups of shots:
Group “3hits”: all shots in which the previous three shots (or more) were a hit,
Group “3misses”: all shots in which the previous three shots (or more) were a miss,
M&S working paper (5000th printing; currently sold out) From here, it is natural to reason as follows: if Stephen Curry always has the same chance of success, then he is like a coin, so we can consider each group of shots as independent; after all, each shot has been assigned at random either to one of three groups: “3hits,”“3misses,” or neither. So far this reasoning is correct. Now, GVT (implicitly) took this intuitive reasoning one step further: because all shots, which are independent, have been assigned at random to each of the groups, we should expect the field goal percentages to be the same in each group. This is the part that is wrong.
Where does this seemingly fine thinking go wrong? The first clue that there is a problem is that the variable that is being used to assign shots to groups is also showing up as a response variable in the computation of the field goal percentage, though this does not fully explain the problem. The key issue is that there is a bias in how shots are being selected for each group. Let’s see this by first focusing on the “3hits” group. Under the assumptions of GVT’s statistical test, Stephen Curry has a 50% chance of success on each shot, i.e. he is like a coin: heads for hit, and tails for miss. Now, suppose we plan on flipping a coin 100 times, then selecting at random among the flips that are immediately preceded by three consecutive heads, and finally checking to see if the flip we selected is a heads, or a tails. Now, before we flip, what is the probability that the flip we end up selecting is a heads? The answer is that this probability is not 0.50, but 0.46! Herein lies the selection bias. The flips that are being selected for analysis are precisely Joshua Miller, in Las Vegas after winning $5 million from economists who accepted his challenge to bet against P(H|HHH) < P(H) when sampling from finite sequence of coin tosses the flips that are immediately preceded by three consecutive heads. Now, returning to the world of basketball shots, this way of selecting shots for analysis implies that for the “3hits” group, there would be a 0.46 chance that the shot we are selecting is a hit, and for the “3misses” group, there would be a 0.54 chance that the shot we are selecting is a hit.
Therefore, if Stephen Curry does not get hot, i.e. if he always has a 50% chance of success for the 100 shots we study, we should expect him to shoot 46% after a streak of three or more hits, and 54% after a streak of three or more misses. This is the order of magnitude of the bias that was built into the original hot hand study, and this is the bias that is depicted in Figure 2 on page 13 of our new paper , and a simpler version of this figure is below. This bias is large in basketball terms: a difference of more than 8 percentage points is nearly the difference between the median NBA Three Point shooter, and the very best. Another way to look at this bias is to imagine what would happen if we were to invite 100 players to participate in GVT’s experiment, with each player shooting from positions in which the chance of success on each shot were 50%. For each player check to see if his/her field goal percentage after a streak of three or more hits is higher than his/her field goal percentage after a streak of three or more misses. For how many players should we expect this to be true? Correct answer: 40 out of 100 players.
This selection bias is large enough to invalidate the conclusions of GVTs original study, without having to analyze any data. However, beyond this “negative” message, there is also a way forward. Namely, we can re-analyze the original Cornell dataset, but in a way invulnerable to the bias. It turns out that when we do this, we find considerable evidence of the hot hand in this data. First, if we look at Table 4 in GVT (page 307), we see that, on average, players shot around 3.5 percentage points better when on a hit streak of three or more shots, and that 64% of the players shot better when on a hit streak than when on a miss streak. While GVT do not directly analyze these summary averages, given our Adam Sanjurjo Hermida, professional tennis player currently ranked 624th in world. Very hot hand predicted by M&S sometime in April 2016 knowledge of the bias, they are telling (in fact, you can do much more with Table 4; see Kenny LJ respond to his own question here ). With the correct analysis (described in the next post), there is statistically significant evidence of the hot hand in the original data set, and, as can be seen in Table 2 on page 23 of our new paper , the point estimate of the average hot hand effect size is large (further details in our “Cold Shower” paper here ). If one adjusts for the bias, what one now finds is that: (1) hitting a streak of three or more shots in a row is associated with an expected 10 percentage points boost in a player’s field goal percentage, (2) 76% of players have a higher field goal percentage when on a hit vs. miss streak, (3) and 4 out of 26 players have a large enough effect to be individually significant by conventional statistical standards (p<.05), which itself is a statistically significant result on the number of significant effects, by conventional standards.
In a later post, we will return to the details of GVT’s paper, and talk about the evidence for the hot hand found across other datasets. If you prefer not to wait, please take a look at our Cold Shower paper , and related comments on Gelman’s blog ).
In the next installment, we will discuss the counter-intuitive probability problem that reveals the bias, and explain what is driving the selection bias there. We will then discuss some common misconceptions about the nature of the selection bias, and some very interesting connections with classic probability paradoxes."

SUBSCRIBE 4 Reasons Organic Search Is Better Getting traffic from paid advertising and social sites is wonderful -- but not if it results in the neglect of your organic efforts, argues columnist Kristine Schachinger.

Remember when you used to rely solely on search engines for traffic? Remember when you worked on SEO and lived and died by your placement in Google? Were you #1? Assured success. Well, okay, maybe not assured . Success only came if the keywords were relevant to your site users, but it was the only real roadmap to generating site traffic and revenue.
Today, we live in a different world. We diversify. We use AdWords and Bing Ads. We create identities across social platforms, and we promote via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. No longer are sites living and dying by their Google Rankings. Organic is no longer one of the cool kids. Organic is passé. Or is it?
Diversification is a must, and — if we are smart in our digital marketing plans — we no longer live or die by Google’s hand alone, but have we forgotten about our organic listings and how beneficial they can be? …T he clear champion of website traffic is organic search. Overwhelmingly, organic search trumps other traffic generators, driving 51% of all visitors for both B2B and B2C businesses. BrightEdge, Cracking the Content 2014 New Trend
At our agency, we work with sites of varying sizes, from very large to quite small, and recently, we have noticed a trend at the enterprise level. These sites aren’t relying as much on Google for traffic any more. Not only are they not relying on Google traffic, but also, the sites are getting less than 10 percent (or slightly more) of their organic traffic from the search giant.
Now, it is not that these sites are not interested in Google users. In fact, they have hired us to help them increase their share. However, they are getting so much traffic from sites like Facebook that it seems there is less urgency about attracting this traffic and less willingness to change the site to meet organic standards. Not long ago, sites would urgently and unquestioningly abide by Google’s standards to court that traffic.
Yet, is this the right direction? With the shrinking of organic listings and the push below the fold across many SERPs, is organic still worth it? Here are four reasons why you should not overlook your organic listings. 4 Reasons Organic Still Matters 1. Organic Still Rocks
Although it may have changed slightly since BrightEdge published its report last year, the data still seem to hold true. Organic is simply better for delivering relevant traffic. The only channel that performs better in some capacities is paid search ads, but that is only for conversions, not overall traffic delivery (Paid Search only accounted for 10 percent of overall total traffic).
However, we do find that by combining channels we can outperform either channel by itself. BrightEdge research supports that a blended approach is best for delivering high performing content. Not only will combining organic and paid search increase website traffic, but it will offer a bigger return on the investment. Take Retail, Technology and Hospitality industries, for example — organic and paid search combined make up more than two-thirds of their total revenue. BrightEdge, Cracking the Content 2014
So if you are neglecting your organic listings, your paid are not doing as well as they could, either. You are leaving money on the table in both organic and paid search. 2. No Control
When auditing sites, we often see that the client is getting as much as 40 percent to 60 percent of their traffic from Facebook. This traffic is sending their visits through the stratosphere. Yet their Google traffic is low — some of the lowest we have seen for sites of these kinds (typically publishers). Chart by Simply Measured based on Parse.ly’s Research on Social Accounts
When I see this, my brain hurts a little. Yes, the love affair with Facebook traffic is very real and occurs for a good reason. A site sending you millions of visitors via a single referral source is a marketer’s dream come true. Well… it is until it isn’t.
Walled Gardens Have Their Own Rules
With Facebook (or any social media site), you are working inside a closed system, a walled garden. This means that while your section of it may be flourishing, you have no control over how that garden gets fed or if it gets watered at all.
What if Facebook decides that you no longer get to show off that garden of yours? What if Twitter decides to personalize the feed? What if Pinterest cuts off your affiliate links? These questions are very real because all of these have happened or are in the works.
When you are using social media platforms for your site traffic, you are at the mercy of that platform. If Facebook cuts organic viewing, you have to pay. If Twitter decides to segment the algorithm, how do you get seen? And if Pinterest removes all affiliate links, how do you replace that traffic?
When you don’t have control over the environment that’s driving your revenue, you may wind up with a hefty advertising bill to generate traffic that is lost when the company changes how the platform surfaces your content. Generally, these changes happen overnight or over a few weeks. That is not much time to adjust, especially for large companies.
But Google Does This Too, Right?
Well, yes and no. Sure, you can get hit with an algorithm change or penalty that destroys all your traffic. However, if you have good people who know what they are doing, this is not likely to happen, and if it does, it is easy (in most cases) to get your visits back. Panda and Penguin are another story, but if you get hit by those it is typically not accidental.
So though you may have to increase your spend in advertising to help replace the traffic while you fix your issues, the issues are fixable, and the traffic can be returned. You will not be replacing it forever, in most cases. (Again, Penguin and Panda are the exceptions because of the long time between updates.) 3. Site “Stickiness”
Social media and paid ads might be traffic generators, but they are not long-term customer creators. The bounce rates are high, and the number of pages visited is often very low, in my experience.
Of course, this makes perfect sense. If I come from my Facebook feed, I am likely to view one page and leave. What we see is that these site visitors generally view between 1.2 and 2 pages.
Facebook is meant to drive article visits, not overall site traffic and customer loyalty. Twitter is meant to promote customer loyalty, not create post traffic. Pinterest users hardly leave the site unless you are selling something. In that case, paid ads are offering the user a reason to come visit, but not necessarily a reason to come back. Business Insider Social Commerce Report, Jun 2015
Organic is different. Matching keywords to user intent means you may be present in many searches. The user may find you consistently, and once they get to your site, they are more likely to stay. Organic users are still your best long-term customers. In my experience, they have lower bounce rates and more pages visited, and they are more likely to return.
So if you want to sell something or gain brand awareness, social is an excellent channel. If you want people to find your store and remember you, organic is the way to go. Diversification is key because each platform has a different ROI potential. Organic is one of the strongest of these, and organic+paid can hit it out of the park.
From our experience with large scale social traffic generators, social just can’t deliver the same level of quality traffic, even if your site sees 50+ percent of its traffic from Facebook. 4. Investment
The issue with paid referral sources, whether Google AdWords or Facebook Advertising, is that the traffic only lasts as long as you feed the meter. Pull your money, and you will see an instant dip in traffic.
As I already mentioned, these users are not seeking you out; you ran across their path and they thought “Oh, cool, something I need right now!” If they have an excellent experience on your site, they may come back, but the ratio of retained visitors from paid is low in the sites we see.
When you’re paying for your traffic, it is like renting. You get an immediate action, but there is no long-term buy-in from most of the visitors you get this way.
With organic search, the user mindset is different. In that case, the user is looking for you, or at least what you sell/offer/publish. When they find you, if you provided an excellent experience, they often come back. If you are an unknown brand, repetitive appearances across results can start to increase brand recognition and brand loyalty.
If you get into the Knowledge Graph, you are the on-page authority in the result.
Investment Levels
In addition, if you invest in organic, you can, at times, lower that investment to maintenance levels or even take a break if needed.
Though a long break is never suggested, there are times that money can be shifted and put towards other resources for a short time. A good example would be an online retailer. In the couple of weeks leading up to the Christmas holidays, you are unlikely to get more organic placement than you already have. Besides, the window of opportunity for shipping gifts to arrive before Christmas is ending, and you are heading into a slow season.
You might decide to take an “organic break” and shift that money into immediate “last minute” sales through paid advertising. Your organic will not suffer, and your money will generate additional traffic.
When you do this, if the site is still doing what it needs to do by producing content, keeping a tight rein on technical issues and monitoring its inbound link profile, you will not generally lose any significant amounts of traffic, unless you’re in a highly competitive industry, or if you changed something that damaged your site in Google’s eyes.
You cannot do this with paid. When the money goes away, so does the majority of the traffic that came with it. Don’t Let Your Organic Die on the Vine
While you are reveling in all your Facebook visits and paid advertising, don’t forget to invest in your organic results. These results will sustain you during those times when you cannot put more money into your paid budgets.
Organic traffic is a completely different type of traffic from what you’ll receive from any paid or social channels.
Organic is what people are looking for; the rest of these simply put things in front of people who may or may not be seeking what you offer. We know that approximately X number of people are looking for Y every day. So if we can get on front of those people, we have a much greater opportunity to create long-term relationships and increase our overall ROI.
Diversification is good, but organic still rocks. Make sure you don’t neglect yours.

FAYETTEVILLE, AR--(Marketwired - October 13, 2015) - DataRank ( www.datarank.com ), an emerging social intelligence provider, today announced that they have been acquired by the leading social media analytics solution, Simply Measured ( www.simplymeasured.com ).

Most social marketing solutions focus on streamlining the execution process, with analytics as an afterthought, leaving the biggest challenges unresolved.
""We have proven the importance of social intelligence by helping leading enterprise brands research, discover and take action on their most important social conversations,"" said DataRank CEO, Ryan Frazier. ""The partnership with Simply Measured gives us the ability to help marketers through all of their critical campaign stages, from research, to measurement, to justifying ROI after the fact.

Simply Measured has experienced exponential growth over the last year, increasing its enterprise customer base and acquiring social ROI data provider, Inside Social.
""The main struggle for marketers today is how to find, understand and leverage data to improve campaign performance for their brand,"" stated Simply Measured CEO, Adam Schoenfeld. ""Basing campaign decisions on passive listening and vanity metrics is no longer enough to show social ROI or justify the investment to CMOs. Marketers need real social intelligence and research to discover new opportunities, understand online conversation, and take action. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we're providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success.""
DataRank, a Y-Combinator company, has risen to success after growing their customer base by 150 percent over the past year and launched DataRank Sonar, an innovative social media command center that delivers real-time visual updates about your brand.
The DataRank team will join Simply Measured on their quest to develop the most comprehensive analytics solution in the social intelligence market.

"The 3 Big Steps for a Successful YouTube Channel 2015-08-25T11:03:43+00:00 Bridget Quigg
As a marketer, you know that high-quality video requires cash and that the more creative you can be, the better. With all that pressure, what are some of the most simple and powerful choices you can make to develop a strong YouTube presence on a budget? Social Marketing Planning & Strategy Kit Download
The following three steps cost you nothing but time and give you lots of room to test and study how YouTube is working for you.
Like any marketing channel, you need to figure out who your audience is, how they like to be addressed, and develop a consistent, signature style that keeps them (and their friends) coming back for more. Step 1: Figure Out Your Vibe
YouTube videos from companies range from buttoned-up CEO interviews where everyone talks about everyone in the third person, to pumped up teens shredding the gnar-pow and yelling into the camera their camo ski gear. We’ve got many different vibes to choose from, people. What’s yours?
One key decision is whether you’ll talk into the camera, directly at your audience, or entertain them with a show that doesn’t not engage them directly. In theater world, they call it the fourth wall and you either break it or you don’t.
The benefits of talking directly into the camera at your audience is that it’s more casual and friendly. It creates a “we’re with you” energy and makes your brand feel more like a friend who can hang out than an authority for them to admire.
Check out James, the Clairol Color Director. This man is here to help you! He’s so on your side, with plenty of useful information about how to go platinum blonde at home.
The benefits of keeping that fourth wall closed is…well, you’re more likely to come off as an authority for them to admire. Whatever information you’re giving them will seem more weighty, even it if it is where to buy your heavy equipment.
In this testimonial video by John Deere, the man being interviewed doesn’t talk into the camera and the whole video has a more serious vibe because of that.
You can also get more artsy and sophisticated if you don’t talk directly to the audience. You could seem more cool, like Cartier does, for example. Cartier will not be talking directly to us anytime soon. Mais non!
And, what is cooler than driving around Paris in a 1950’s-era Mercedes, flirting with someone using really expensive jewelery? I can’t think of anything.
Keep in mind, if you don’t talk to your audience directly in your video, you have the comments section to engage them even more intimately, sparking chatter and responding to them. Gettin’ social on your social! Step 2: Study Your Audience
Who are the people behind your “views”? Cheers to YouTube, they offer some handy analytics and a number of reports on your audience. I suggest you look first at their Demographics Report. It tells you information like age, gender, and top locations by views. YouTube’s Demographics Report tells you about your current audience’s gender, age, and location.
You can also use their Traffic Sources Report to find out the sites and YouTube features that viewers use to find your content. The Devices Report and Playback Locations report also give you clues about your audience’s tech tendencies. YouTube’s Devices Report lets you know if people are watching your videos from a computer, mobile device, or other source.
If you keep track of these metrics over time, you’ll have a better sense of your core audience. What’s almost always the same – their over 30 years old, they watch your videos from a game console, or they’re more than 50% female?
Ideally, your YouTube audience will surprise you with a whole new demographic you didn’t know your brand could attract. That would be good to put in your report for your boss. Step 3: Pick Your “Thing”
Consistency is your friend on YouTube. Try not to go from game show to stop-motion animation to interview series. Be consistent to build a loyal audience.
Offering your fans a regular format, schedule, or other recurring element will grow your channel more quickly. We here at Simply Measured are pretty darn proud of our cool, stamp-thing at the beginning of each video.
Another signature style comes from surf equipment company Hurley. They have their series of #TOURNOTES videos that have lured in a healthy following. The videos are casual, with real, pro surfers talking to the video crew in all their shirtless coolness.
And, the videos always start and end with the same image and sound. “B p!”
Also, your actual content should be fairly narrow to start. Focus your efforts so that viewers know exactly what they’ll get when they subscribe to you.
H&M does this nicely. Their followers get fashion fun in all forms. There are H&M collection releases, behind-the-scenes photoshoot videos, tutorials on hair and make-up, and the occasional superstar surprise. (David Beckham, Beyonce, and Lady Gaga have all appeared in videos on H&M’s channel.) But, the goal of every video is education on fashion and style.
Before you rush off to follow H&M, take a moment to consider your best way to offer regular, useful video content that is unique to you. YouTube Success for All
Gosh darn’t, there’s an audience on YouTube for you. You just gotta be yourself and pay attention to who is paying attention to you. Any successes you’d like to share with all of us? Surprises are the best. Let us know what you’ve learned about your YouTube audience. Get everything you need to analyze the metrics that matter Social Marketing Planning & Strategy Kit"

"11 Free Blogging Tools to Help You Identify and Understand Your Audience 0 SHARES November 8, 2015 Blogging 0 Blogging – do you love it or do you love it? For those converted to the church of blogging, you can’t deny the results it can generate for your business, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A blog post is part of the marketing automation universe in that sense – as long as people are on search engines, looking for solutions to their pain points, blog posts need to exist in order to draw them to the right websites. And as long as you are looking to optimise for Google, you have to constantly consider the quality signals your website is giving the search giant . A lot of companies still make the fatal mistake of confusing blogging with posting updates about their product. This is a no-no. If you have a designated blog for product updates and “how-tos”, go right ahead! But that can’t be your core business blog. That, my friend, has to reach those who’ve barely heard of you and need convincing that you’re the right provider of a solution for them (i.e. the vast majority of your website visitors). And in order to develop a better quality signal to search engines, you have to create the right content for your visitors – and this content is most likely going to benefit from the support of a blog behind it. How can a blog support the rest of my website and my business? A blog gives both “hard” and “soft” return on investment. it generates traffic it generates prospects >> have a “subscribe to the blog” option to gather email addresses it helps convert these prospects all the way down the sales and marketing funnel it establishes your business’s authority on a subject – this is important a) for Google ranking and b) convincing visitors your business can solve their pain point it is a forum for visitors to ask questions and have discussions it gives a place for others to link back to, thus boosting your website authority in search engines and improving your reputation it gives people something to share on social networks it gives YOU something to share on social networks – nobody wants to see a brand only sharing their product all the time it humanises the company, literally putting a face to the name – trust is priceless in business it can give you the competitive advantage Jumping in: the 5 main types of blog posts The typical business blog post is one of these five formats: Recommended for You The SlideShare Presentation Post The Newsjacking Post But wait! What is the Number One thing you have to do before typing a letter? Identify your audience. Your blogging will be wasted if you are not a) writing up solutions to your potential and returning visitors’ problems, and b) writing it in style that reflects your audience. Luckily, there are a ton of free resources out there to get you started on your research to write the best, most targeted blog posts you possibly can! A final important note is to remember not to begin your blogging ideas research by brainstorming first. Begin with learning the language your audience is using – just to make sure you’re building the most successful base possible for the business. Assumptions can kill. Here’s a blueprint for how to write the perfect blog post: 11 free tools to help you identify and understand your blog audience
Yes you’ve waited long enough and here are your free blogging tools: 1. InboundRank InboundRank is a ranking of the top blogs in the UK and Ireland. What is key about using this tool to identify your competitors is that it specifically ranks blogs. You can spend hours and hours searching your competitors only to find they don’t have a blog at all! And everyone needs a place to start. With InboundRank, you can take a look at the best blogs in the business, and start to understand the layout of popular blogs, as well as the quality and quantity of posts. You’ll get an idea of their writing style and start to develop a base of “best practices” that will get you started.
2. Alexa Now that you have a selection of competitor blog URLs, take them and drop them into Alexa Rank. Scroll down and take notes on the general demographic trends. Is the data more or less similar? If so, you have the right pool of URLs to compare to. This is important in order to reach “ data saturation ” (sufficient data from a correct sample group). If they are all wildly different, you may want to double-check that they are definitely a competitor for your company. 3. Similar Web SimilarWeb is – ironically – for a similar purpose here. This tool will give you a broad overview of audience interests of your competitor blogs, as well as a wordcloud of topics of interest. SimilarWeb provides plenty of useful information but for the purposes of designing a blog research process, I’ll stick to this particular piece of data! 4. Open Site Explorer by Moz Another thing you want to double-check (because I like to check via more than one source!) is the backlink quality of the blogs you’ve selected to base yourself off of. It’s also a great way of starting to get more granular in your understanding of the audiences these blogs attract. People who respect those blogs, and who are interested in in the subject material (i.e. potential leads!), will be linking back to them. You’ll start to get a real view of the kind of networks you are dealing with, potential future co-marketing partners, and more. 5. SEM rush Similar to Open Site Explorer, this is a resource to discover backlinks and their quality, and the type of places that are linking back to the content of your competitor blogs. Do take the data with a grain of salt, however; not every backlink will be relevant. You will start to recognise the links that do and do not matter to your business goals. Use this in combination with Open Site Explorer to refine your hitlist of backlinks that you will want to work with in the future. 6. AHREFS Ahrefs is a great free tool to discover what content from the blogs is the most successful, and on which channel you can focus on. Buzzsumo is very similar, but you may or may not be up for the paid plan :) In Ahrefs, you can search by domain OR by keyword, and gather plenty of intel on what your blogging strategy should entail. You will also start to really get a feeling for the writing style that works for your audience. 7. SocialMention SocialMention allows you to iterate your blogging strategy one step further by seeing where and by whom content from a blog is being shared. You can identify forums where your audience resides, and start to gather some broad keyword categories to inform your future blog topic choices. 8. Simply Measured I love SImplyMeasured but it’s limitation is that if your audience is not on Twitter… well, you get the idea. Now, many digital marketers hope to find at least some of their target audience there – but just be aware that some industries and demographics will be less represented. 9. Make my persona This is when you finally begin to create your target persona. And don’t limit yourself to just one! There are always going to be multiple. I would recommend no more than 3 to start off as writing for three different personas is challenge enough. Use this Word Doc generator to get your first notes on your target blog audience in order before taking it to the next level. 10. Buyer persona template and interview template This downloadable template and interview guide is more advanced and will set up a solid foundation for your blogging strategy. Because after all – you are writing so that ultimately your company will grow! The buyer persona and the target audience for your blog are one and the same. Take the time to complete this carefully, and use it as your manual for blogging success. 11. UberSuggest ….and finally, some keyword brainstorming at last! This is a fantastic tool to give you long-tail suggestions on what you could be writing about. Never start blogging trying to rank for single words or 2-word phrases. The competition is crazy. Go for longer search terms and build your authority from there. What are your favourite blogging tips? Please let us know in the comments below!"

Friday, October 9, 2015 Fairy Costume for Halloween {DIY} Halloween! One of my favorite days because I get to play dress up with my son. He is always awed by my costumes every year and this year will be no exception. You would think I’d have an idea about what I wanted to be but last year I was Storm and had waited years before that costume came to fruition. My creative juices weren’t flowing this year so I looked to pinterest for inspiration. As a Walmart mom I was challenged to make a DIY costume and I debated about it for awhile and finally decided on being a fairy. This costume is the right mix of outfit and makeup, fun for me all the way around! I started by making a skirt from tulle and gossamer, I DO NOT SEW so it was important for me to find a no sew solution. If you can make knots, you too can make a tulle skirt - for yourself for fashion or even for a child’s costume. I purchased a total of 10 yards of material - 8 (97 cents per yd) yards of pink tulle and 2 yards ($4.00 per yd) of white gossamer. I used ribbon that I had in my craft room as the base for my skirt. I simply wrapped the ribbon around my waist where I wanted the skirt to hit and made knots at each end, leaving a good amount of ribbon hanging to form a bow when I wear the skirt. I cut the material into approximately four inch strips - this was the most tedious part of making the skirt and I eyeballed it, having the strips perfectly measured wasn’t important. Next starting at one knot, I folded the pink tulle in half, placed the loop over the ribbon and pulled the free ends through the loop to make the first column in the skirt. I repeated this process three more times and then did the same with one strip of the white gossamer. I followed this pattern of 4 pink,1 white until I reached the final knot and my skirt was completed. The next step was making my shirt. I purchased a Faded Glory long sleeve crew tee from Walmart for $6.94. I sprayed it with Elmer’s Multipurpose Spray adhesive and then sprinkled it with silver glitter, I had both in my craft room but they are available at Walmart. I allowed the tee to dry overnight. The next day I added pink flowers to the shirt by using my glue gun. My craft room was again my source for the flowers. My fairy costume would not be complete without shoes, so I repurposed an old pair of black ballet flats from my closet. I painted the shoes with white acrylic paint, allowed them to dry overnight and then added two pink flowers using my glue gun the next day to complete the shoes. For my floral headband, I purchased glittery pink elastic ($2.00) from Walmart and I simply measured it around my head tightly because of course elastic stretches leaving enough room for a knot. I once again glued pink flowers to the band using my glue gun and tied a knot at the end to complete it. Of course, no fairy costume would be complete without fairy wings and I wanted to make a big statement so I purchased large purple wings from a costume store. My outfit was complete and next up was my makeup. I wanted to have an ethereal look so I stuck with my theme of pink and purple. After applying my regular foundation, I applied Hard Candy eyeshadow primer from my smokey eye pallet to my lids. Next, I used my own highly pigmented pink shadow, I received it from a goodie bag earlier this year, and it is perfect for my costume. In the crease of my lids I used Black Radiance duel eye definer in eggplant/mauve ($3.43) - and used mauve to achieve a subtle smokey eye. In the corners of my eyes I used Wet & Wild Fergie on Edge long wearing eyeliner pencil in China White ($2.69). I used the same two products for my brows - eggplant to fill and define them and China White to highlight my brow bone. To define my lower lashes, I lined them with purple from the Hard Candy Glitteratzi Call Me Sparkle glitter gel palette ($6.00). Next, I used a little of the white glitter from the palette to my lids. To add to the drama, I used a pair of peacock feather strip false lashes. These were a gift from two years ago but were perfect for my costume. For glowing cheeks I used Hard Candy Cheeks and Balances Highlight and Contour Cheek duo in Sweet Cheeks ($6.00). For my lips, I lined them with eggplant from my Black Radiance Dual Eye definer (as you can see, I use products for multipurposes on my face!). My lipstick choice is Black Radiance Lip Color in African Violet ($1.99). The final touch for my face was applying purple pearls around my eyes. I purchased them in the craft jewelry section at Walmart for $3.00. I applied them by using my false eyelash adhesive. It was simple to do and added the final touch! And although it wasn't planned, my choice of purple hair is the perfect accent for my costume! I am totally in love with my costume for this year. I am a fairy and can proudly say with the exception of the wings, I diy’d my entire look! My son saw my costume and was quite excited, I cannot wait for us to go trick or treating on Halloween!

"Quote: : Do you have proof that a scientific consensus has been reached on freeze-thaw or the correct DC trafficking approach? --RK
A what? Usually evidence of a ""consensus"" occurs when many different studies cite the same reference and provide additional proof of the same. That I have already supplied, multiple times.
And by ""DC trafficking approach"" do you mean methodology to test for trafficking of DC or delivery method of DC vaccine? Literature describes both ID and IN delivery methods as ""effective."" But, as DC vaccines really aren't ""effective"" at thwarting progression of cancer I only mean produce some immune response. Which may matter or may not. Cancer vaccines have shown so far lots of fun immune stuff but no extension of survival. Except Provenge. But that's a more complex thing.
Quote: : The most comprehensive study to date based on what, the data derived from it? --RK
This:
http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/19/6/1525.long
Based on the culmination of much prior work, and being one of the most cited, thoroughly referenced studies on DC trafficking. That enough for you, or?...
Quote: :
How do you account for the fact that T-cell responses showed up before the Phase I/II booster stage? Unless DC are traveling to lymph nodes, that's not going to happen. --RK
No that's not true. ""T-cell responses"" are measured in various ways. Simply measuring t-cell activity before, during and after chemo will show all sorts of variability. Oftentimes researchers measure ""t-cell response"" by way of how much TNF is in the patient's blood. That has a mixed correlation with survival, however.
Now if you mean antigen specific t-cell responses, that gets more interesting. But no, I haven't seen much of that with WTL loaded DC vaccines. Though even if I did, I wouldn't give it oodles of credibility. The immune system rebounds from chemo in dynamic ways. Patients almost always show some antigen-specific t-cells in blood serum prior to chemo, and also some time after. not much during though (lymphopenia). Still, you would at least theoretically be right that, IF that was occurring by way of a multi-fold increase or something, then SOME DC might be getting to lymphs and producing SOME kind of immunogenic t-cell response.
Anyway there's also this, which I know you've read before:
Quote: : An intuitive and commonly used surrogate end point in immunotherapy trials is measurement of changes in the immune system (11, 31). This may be accomplished by assessment of antigen-specific cytotoxicity or T-cell proliferation, determination of T-cell reactivity by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) or intracellular cytokine assays, enumeration of tetramer-reactive T cells, or quantification of antigen-specific antibodies compared before and after vaccination (32).
It is now clear, however, that the mere induction of very high levels of tumor-reactive T cells in circulation is often inadequate to offer protection from cancer recurrence or mediate cancer regression in realistic animal models or in human patients. For example, in pmel-1 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, where greater than 95% of all CD8+ T cells are reactive against a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted epitope derived from the shared melanoma/melanocyte antigen gp100, tumor growth is identical in transgenic mice and in non-transgenic littermate controls (33, 34).
Similarly in humans, very high levels (in excess of 10% of all peripheral blood CD8+ T cells) have been raised against an HLA-A*0201 restricted gp100-epitope through prime-boosting in adjuvant melanoma patients with no objective evidence of disease (35). Despite these impressively high levels of circulating anti-tumor T cells, there was no apparent difference in the rates at which patients experienced recurrence of their disease.
Taken together, these data suggest that while measurement of precursor frequency provides some immunological data, including whether or not a vaccine is sufficient to cause immune activation and expansion, currently available assays are not necessarily predictive of patient benefit.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075547/
It probably just won't matter. That's why I don't like DC vaccines as monotherapies or adjuvants to simple chemos in general. Something like ICT-107 + PD1 inhib + CTLA-4 inhib would be VERY interesting imho though.
Quote: :
How do you account for the fact that the top medical centers specializing in GBM signed up to join the study first, including when the study resumed in 2011? --RK
Which you repeat like:
Quote: :
So if consensus is the DC lysate freeze-thaw method is inferior and is subject to failure why are reputable clinical sites with top scientist continuing to sign up? --RK
$$$. Frankly they will run any sponsor's study given an IND to do so. Any evidence they won't?
Such a weird ""point"" I keep hearing longs making. It means nothing in terms of validation the therapy may be effective. Personal feelings of a therapy's chances or opinions of the tech are laid aside. Judgement's are suspended until A LOT of controlled data are in or better yet, until FDA approval (or CRL). Like iwasadiver. He represents the clinician POV very well imo.
Lots of junky therapies with almost no shot have been in trials at world renowned centers. That argument is just so bad...

"How to get faster fiber-optic pipes through computation Calculation compensates for fiber imperfection, may increase data rates. by Chris Lee - Aug 20, 2015 3:18 pm UTC Virginia Tech
The information age demands fat pipes. But making fat pipes is not always as easy as it sounds. Consider our current generation of fiber optic communications. Compared to microwave systems, where every symbol communicates something like one or two bytes of data, most current optical systems are limited to one to four bits per symbol.
This hasn’t mattered so much because many lasers, each with a different wavelength—called a channel—can be used on the same fiber, and the rate at which we send those bits is astonishingly high. Single channel capacities are way in excess of 40Gb/s range—40Gb/s was in testing the last time I taught a telecommunications course, and in 2012, various companies were testing 160Gb/s per channel. These incredible capacities, however, are achieved under very stringent conditions: the optical power must remain low and the optical properties of the fiber must be carefully controlled (something called dispersion management).
The increase from 40Gb/s to 160Gb/s also represented the switch from encoding one bit per symbol to four bits per symbol. However, these encoding systems require that there is considerably more optical power per channel, and this causes problems with the stringent conditions mentioned above. This has made increases beyond four bits per symbol difficult. Funnily enough, everyone has kind-of-sorta known how to solve the problem, but no one was willing to simply bite the bullet and do it. At least until now . Dimming the lights
Before we come to the latest and greatest, let us discuss how current fiber optic technology sucks. Let's start with something called dispersion. Every material has a refractive index. This can be thought of as the degree to which light is slowed by the material. For glass, the refractive index is about 1.3, so light travels at a third of its speed in a vacuum. This, by itself, is not a problem—the problem is that the refractive index is different for each color of light.
One way to communicate optically is to blink the light source. In a very simple encoding scheme, a bright flash might encode a one, while darkness encodes a zero. We set a clock speed for the maximum rate of blinking and then simply measure the light intensity in each time-slot. To communicate faster, we make the light pulses shorter and shorter, and make the corresponding time-slots smaller and smaller. But to make a pulse of light requires a range of colors, rather than a single pure color. The shorter the pulse, the broader the range of colors.
The first problem you run into is that as the bandwidth required by a channel increases (due to the range of colors required to generate the short pulse), the spacing between the frequencies used for channels must increase. At some point, the total capacity no longer increases because the increased capacity of the individual channel comes at the cost of reducing the total number of channels.
But before you even get that far, the dispersion of the fiber destroys the link. Typically, red colors experience a slightly smaller refractive index and blue colors a slightly higher refractive index. The result is that the red colors move faster and “run away” from the blue colors, so the pulse of light spreads out. This causes two problems: light leaks into neighboring timeslots, which potentially changes their bit value. And the peak light intensity drops, making it harder to detect the bright flashes that were originally in their time slots. An accidental glow
So imagine we have a special optical fiber. This fiber has a refractive index that ensures light pulses will not spread out, even if they have a range of colors. Unfortunately, the refractive index is the linear response of a material to light, and materials don’t just respond linearly; they also have a nonlinear response.
You can think of it like this: light is an electromagnetic wave, where the electric field amplitude varies smoothly with time in a particular pattern, called a sinusoid. The electrons in the material vibrate in sympathy with this field—their movement follows the field, albeit with a small time delay. That is the linear response of the material. However, the electrons can't always exactly follow the field, causing tiny deviations. These tiny deviations are the nonlinear response of the medium, and they are, as intimated, individually tiny.
The importance of this only comes clear when you realize that electrons radiate light as they accelerate. So, when electrons follow the incoming light’s field exactly, they accelerate continuously and radiate light with exactly the same color as the incoming light. However, when electrons don’t follow the field exactly, the color of light that they radiate is not exactly the same as the incoming light.
If this happened in a purely random way—say a white glow that was evenly spread across all channels—then this would cause problems, but probably not serious ones. But the nonlinear behavior of the fiber is exactly like a bored kid: it does specifically the thing that you most want it not to do. Let's imagine we have ten channels that are separated from their neighbors by constant frequency gaps. The electrons don’t know about this, so they simply try to follow the total electric field, which is the sum of the fields from the light all these different channels.
The result is that the nonlinear response of the medium will cause channel one to mix with adjacent channels, and generate light that has exactly the frequency for another channel. So, for example, light from channels one, three, and four will combine to generate light in channel two. And, as the light propagates down the fiber, this process continues, reducing the light contributing signal and increasing the noise in other channels. Low power solutions
This problem is solved by keeping the total optical power per channel as low as possible. And we ensure that the pulses are allowed to spread out (using dispersion), then pull them back together by using a section of fiber with exactly the opposite dispersion. But, by keeping the power low, we intrinsically limit data speeds and ensure that the distance between repeaters is smaller, making the link more expensive.
What was known was that the physics of these processes are all deterministic. That is, since we know the dispersion of a fiber and the range of colors used in a link, network engineers use a short section of fiber with strong dispersion (but where the blue light travels faster than the red) to compensate the dispersion. Likewise, if we know about the individual channels and the in-channel power, we should be able to predict the crosstalk between channels. And, if you know that, you can do the reverse: that is, compute a waveform that will result in a desired, clean set of pulses exiting the fiber at the other end.
In other words, before a symbol is encoded, we calculate how that symbol will be distorted in the fiber by all the other symbols that are being transmitted at the same time. Then we turn that solution around so that the waveform we input will be shaped by this distortion so as to exit as the undistorted, encoded symbol. This seems simple, but earlier attempts were not notably successful, because each channel was handled independently of the other.
There was seemingly no way to avoid this. If you have a ten channel system, and each channel consists of a laser diode that has been tuned to the center frequency of the channel. Over time, this frequency drifts back and forth over small range around that center frequency. Each laser does this independently, so you cannot accurately predict the relative frequency spacing of the lasers at any given time. This small deviation is enough to severely degrade the accuracy of the calculation, making its usefulness limited.
There is, however, a way around this. A laser's wavelength can be locked to that of another. This by itself doesn't help because both lasers will have the same wavelength, even if that wavelength drifts. The researchers got around this by using something called a frequency comb. Under the right conditions, a laser will emit a series of wavelengths that are all separated by the same frequency (on a spectrum analyzer, it looks like a hair comb, hence the name). One of the frequencies in the comb can be locked to a master laser. Now, as the master laser drifts, the entire comb of frequencies drift together.
At this point, we have a nice stable set of colors, but cannot transmit information. So, some of the combs are used to lock the individual laser diodes. By doing this, the researchers could be certain that each channel laser had a set and fixed center frequency. They used these wavelengths in their calculations to figure out the waveform that they needed to send to compensate for the fiber's nonlinearities.
Under these conditions, however, the new work showed a reasonably dramatic improvement in link transmission. Their test link, which was the equivalent of 1020km long and transmitting at a rate of 64Gb/s (so not top of the line), was designed to emulate a typical long-haul fiber link. They showed that without locking the channel lasers, they could achieve 64Gb/s for channel powers of around 0.2mW. However, once the lasers were locked, their computational scheme allowed them to increase the channel power to 2mW.
This is a nice proof of principle, but, unfortunately, I don’t think we will see it outside the lab for a couple of years yet. In the researchers system, the slaving between a master laser and the slaves was achieved via a third laser that generates something called a frequency comb. Although frequency combs are no longer things of mystery, maintained by graduate students through dark arts, they are still not telecom-cheap either. However, I also know of lots of quite successful efforts to produce frequency combs in a way that is suitable for telecommunications (e.g., cheap and reliable), so I can’t imagine that it will remain in the lab for too long.

Belly fat in men: Why weight loss matters Thursday, 12 November 2015 12:46 Mayo Clinic Staff View Comments If you're carrying a few extra pounds, you're not alone. But this is one case where following the crowd isn't a good idea. Carrying extra weight — especially belly fat — can be risky. Michael D. Jensen, M.D., an endocrinology specialist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., answers common questions about belly fat in men. Why is belly fat a concern for men? The trouble with belly fat is that it's not limited to the extra layer of padding located just below the skin (subcutaneous fat). It also includes visceral fat — which lies deep inside your abdomen, surrounding your internal organs. Regardless of your overall weight, having a large amount of belly fat increases your risk of: • Cardiovascular disease • Sleep apnea Does age or genetics play a role in gaining belly fat? Your weight is largely determined by how you balance the calories you eat with the energy you burn. If you eat too much and exercise too little, you're likely to pack on excess pounds — including belly fat. However, aging plays a role. As you age, you lose muscle — especially if you're not physically active. Loss of muscle mass decreases the rate at which your body uses calories, which can make it more challenging to maintain a healthy weight. In addition, in some men fat cells in the arms and legs lose the ability to store fat, which causes any excess fat to go to the abdomen. Your genes also can affect your chances of being overweight or obese, as well as play a role in where you store fat. Can you really get a beer belly from drinking? Drinking excess alcohol can cause you to gain belly fat — the "beer belly." However, beer alone isn't to blame. Drinking too much alcohol of any kind can increase belly fat, although some research suggests wine might be an exception. If you drink alcohol, do so only in moderation. The less you drink, the fewer calories you'll consume and the less likely you'll be to gain belly fat. How can you tell if you have too much belly fat? So how do you know if you have too much belly fat? Simply measure your waist: • Stand and place a tape measure around your bare stomach, just above your hipbone. If your belly droops, lie down to take the measurement. • Pull the tape measure until it fits snugly around you, but doesn't push into your skin. • Make sure the tape measure is level all the way around. • Relax, exhale and measure your waist, resisting the urge to suck in your stomach. For men, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) indicates an unhealthy concentration of belly fat and a greater risk of health problems. How do you get rid of belly fat? You can tone abdominal muscles with crunches or other targeted abdominal exercises, but just doing these exercises won't get rid of belly fat. However, visceral fat does respond to the same diet and exercise strategies that can help you shed excess pounds and lower your total body fat. To battle the bulge: • Eat a healthy diet. Emphasize plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and choose lean sources of protein and low-fat dairy products. Limit saturated fat, found in meat and high-fat dairy products, such as cheese and butter. Choose moderate amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — found in fish, nuts and certain vegetable oils — instead. • Keep portion sizes in check. Even when you're making healthy choices, calories add up. At home, slim down your portion sizes. In restaurants, share meals — or eat half your meal and take the rest home for another day. • Include physical activity in your daily routine. For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, for at least 150 minutes a week or vigorous aerobic activity, such as jogging, for at least 75 minutes a week. In addition, strength training exercises are recommended at least twice a week. If you want to lose weight or meet specific fitness goals, you might need to exercise more. To lose excess fat and keep it from coming back, aim for slow and steady weight loss — up to 2 pounds (1 kilogram) a week. Consult your doctor for help getting started and staying on track. Remember, you can lose belly fat — it just takes effort and patience. In fact, shedding even a few extra pounds can help you feel better and lower your risk of health problems.

"Scientific Method / Science & Exploration How to get faster fiber-optic pipes through computation Calculation compensates for fiber imperfection, may increase data rates. by Chris Lee - Aug 20, 2015 3:18 pm 12 Virginia Tech The information age demands fat pipes. But making fat pipes is not always as easy as it sounds. Consider our current generation of fiber optic communications. Compared to microwave systems, where every symbol communicates something like one or two bytes of data, most current optical systems are limited to one to four bits per symbol.
This hasn’t mattered so much because many lasers, each with a different wavelength—called a channel—can be used on the same fiber, and the rate at which we send those bits is astonishingly high. Single channel capacities are way in excess of 40Gb/s range—40Gb/s was in testing the last time I taught a telecommunications course, and in 2012, various companies were testing 160Gb/s per channel. These incredible capacities, however, are achieved under very stringent conditions: the optical power must remain low and the optical properties of the fiber must be carefully controlled (something called dispersion management).
The increase from 40Gb/s to 160Gb/s also represented the switch from encoding one bit per symbol to four bits per symbol. However, these encoding systems require that there is considerably more optical power per channel, and this causes problems with the stringent conditions mentioned above. This has made increases beyond four bits per symbol difficult. Funnily enough, everyone has kind-of-sorta known how to solve the problem, but no one was willing to simply bite the bullet and do it. At least until now .
Dimming the lights Before we come to the latest and greatest, let us discuss how current fiber optic technology sucks. Let's start with something called dispersion. Every material has a refractive index. This can be thought of as the degree to which light is slowed by the material. For glass, the refractive index is about 1.3, so light travels at a third of its speed in a vacuum. This, by itself, is not a problem—the problem is that the refractive index is different for each color of light.
One way to communicate optically is to blink the light source. In a very simple encoding scheme, a bright flash might encode a one, while darkness encodes a zero. We set a clock speed for the maximum rate of blinking and then simply measure the light intensity in each time-slot. To communicate faster, we make the light pulses shorter and shorter, and make the corresponding time-slots smaller and smaller. But to make a pulse of light requires a range of colors, rather than a single pure color. The shorter the pulse, the broader the range of colors.
The first problem you run into is that as the bandwidth required by a channel increases (due to the range of colors required to generate the short pulse), the spacing between the frequencies used for channels must increase. At some point, the total capacity no longer increases because the increased capacity of the individual channel comes at the cost of reducing the total number of channels.
But before you even get that far, the dispersion of the fiber destroys the link. Typically, red colors experience a slightly smaller refractive index and blue colors a slightly higher refractive index. The result is that the red colors move faster and “run away” from the blue colors, so the pulse of light spreads out. This causes two problems: light leaks into neighboring timeslots, which potentially changes their bit value. And the peak light intensity drops, making it harder to detect the bright flashes that were originally in their time slots.
An accidental glow So imagine we have a special optical fiber. This fiber has a refractive index that ensures light pulses will not spread out, even if they have a range of colors. Unfortunately, the refractive index is the linear response of a material to light, and materials don’t just respond linearly; they also have a nonlinear response.
You can think of it like this: light is an electromagnetic wave, where the electric field amplitude varies smoothly with time in a particular pattern, called a sinusoid. The electrons in the material vibrate in sympathy with this field—their movement follows the field, albeit with a small time delay. That is the linear response of the material. However, the electrons can't always exactly follow the field, causing tiny deviations. These tiny deviations are the nonlinear response of the medium, and they are, as intimated, individually tiny.
The importance of this only comes clear when you realize that electrons radiate light as they accelerate. So, when electrons follow the incoming light’s field exactly, they accelerate continuously and radiate light with exactly the same color as the incoming light. However, when electrons don’t follow the field exactly, the color of light that they radiate is not exactly the same as the incoming light.
If this happened in a purely random way—say a white glow that was evenly spread across all channels—then this would cause problems, but probably not serious ones. But the nonlinear behavior of the fiber is exactly like a bored kid: it does specifically the thing that you most want it not to do. Let's imagine we have ten channels that are separated from their neighbors by constant frequency gaps. The electrons don’t know about this, so they simply try to follow the total electric field, which is the sum of the fields from the light all these different channels.
The result is that the nonlinear response of the medium will cause channel one to mix with adjacent channels, and generate light that has exactly the frequency for another channel. So, for example, light from channels one, three, and four will combine to generate light in channel two. And, as the light propagates down the fiber, this process continues, reducing the light contributing signal and increasing the noise in other channels.
Low power solutions This problem is solved by keeping the total optical power per channel as low as possible. And we ensure that the pulses are allowed to spread out (using dispersion), then pull them back together by using a section of fiber with exactly the opposite dispersion. But, by keeping the power low, we intrinsically limit data speeds and ensure that the distance between repeaters is smaller, making the link more expensive.
What was known was that the physics of these processes are all deterministic. That is, since we know the dispersion of a fiber and the range of colors used in a link, network engineers use a short section of fiber with strong dispersion (but where the blue light travels faster than the red) to compensate the dispersion. Likewise, if we know about the individual channels and the in-channel power, we should be able to predict the crosstalk between channels. And, if you know that, you can do the reverse: that is, compute a waveform that will result in a desired, clean set of pulses exiting the fiber at the other end.
In other words, before a symbol is encoded, we calculate how that symbol will be distorted in the fiber by all the other symbols that are being transmitted at the same time. Then we turn that solution around so that the waveform we input will be shaped by this distortion so as to exit as the undistorted, encoded symbol. This seems simple, but earlier attempts were not notably successful, because each channel was handled independently of the other.
There was seemingly no way to avoid this. If you have a ten channel system, and each channel consists of a laser diode that has been tuned to the center frequency of the channel. Over time, this frequency drifts back and forth over small range around that center frequency. Each laser does this independently, so you cannot accurately predict the relative frequency spacing of the lasers at any given time. This small deviation is enough to severely degrade the accuracy of the calculation, making its usefulness limited.
There is, however, a way around this. A laser's wavelength can be locked to that of another. This by itself doesn't help because both lasers will have the same wavelength, even if that wavelength drifts. The researchers got around this by using something called a frequency comb. Under the right conditions, a laser will emit a series of wavelengths that are all separated by the same frequency (on a spectrum analyzer, it looks like a hair comb, hence the name). One of the frequencies in the comb can be locked to a master laser. Now, as the master laser drifts, the entire comb of frequencies drift together.
At this point, we have a nice stable set of colors, but cannot transmit information. So, some of the combs are used to lock the individual laser diodes. By doing this, the researchers could be certain that each channel laser had a set and fixed center frequency. They used these wavelengths in their calculations to figure out the waveform that they needed to send to compensate for the fiber's nonlinearities.
Under these conditions, however, the new work showed a reasonably dramatic improvement in link transmission. Their test link, which was the equivalent of 1020km long and transmitting at a rate of 64Gb/s (so not top of the line), was designed to emulate a typical long-haul fiber link. They showed that without locking the channel lasers, they could achieve 64Gb/s for channel powers of around 0.2mW. However, once the lasers were locked, their computational scheme allowed them to increase the channel power to 2mW.
This is a nice proof of principle, but, unfortunately, I don’t think we will see it outside the lab for a couple of years yet. In the researchers system, the slaving between a master laser and the slaves was achieved via a third laser that generates something called a frequency comb. Although frequency combs are no longer things of mystery, maintained by graduate students through dark arts, they are still not telecom-cheap either. However, I also know of lots of quite successful efforts to produce frequency combs in a way that is suitable for telecommunications (e.g., cheap and reliable), so I can’t imagine that it will remain in the lab for too long.

"Native Facebook Videos Get More Reach Than Any Other Type of Post -- according to this study just released by Socialbakers!
http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/2367-native-facebook-videos-get-more-reach-than-any-other-type-of-post

It wasn't that long ago that photo posts trumped all post types in terms of organic reach. However, as Socialbakers points out, ""Because photos were the long-dominant post type, they are both the most common type of post and the most frequently promoted. That alone would be enough to make them less effective than they were at their peak, but coupled with the introduction of videos in Q3 2014, the decline in photo reach has been sudden.""

Videos are promoted more than photos: 27% of all videos are promoted as compared to 17% of photos. However, there are still way more photo posts on Facebook than video posts, making videos more effective at reaching your audience.

BUT, as the article states and I point out in my wee video, this doesn't mean go crazy and post nothing but videos now! :) We all need to keep mixing it up and experimenting with what works for our peeps.

If establishment Republicans think that running negative television advertisements will quell the wave of support for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, Midwest voters say they should think again.
While waiting for Trump to arrive for a rally in Davenport, Iowa, on Saturday, voters who say they are still weighing their options said they would either not be swayed or be more likely to support the billionaire if they were to see negative ads on their televisions bashing the GOP front-runner.
More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Says Political Correctness Helped Enable California Attack
“If anything, I think it’ll stir up Trump’s base more and maybe engage them more,” Curt Anderson, a 20-year-old from Orion, Illinois, said.
Brenda Wolf, 70, from Bettendorf, Iowa, who has still not decided who to vote for, said negative ads would not change her mind. “That has nothing to do with us,” she said. As she pointed to the Trump podium in front of her, she added, “This has everything to do with us.”
In recent weeks, as Trump continues to lead in the polls and the Republican establishment grows more anxious about his potential to ultimately become the party’s nominee, negative ads targeting the real estate mogul have begun cropping up.
More from Bloomberg.com: Cruz, Gaining on Trump in Iowa, Intensifies War Rhetoric
Ohio Governor John Kasich’s super-PAC, New Day for America, has already invested $2.5 million in hostile ads on television, radio, online, and through direct mail. Earlier this year, a Club for Growth super-PAC spent $1 million in Iowa on ads attacking Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCQhBYEMRQI
But those efforts do not seem to be piercing Trump’s Teflon coating, as he continues to hold a commanding lead in national and early-state polling.
In November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Liz Mair, the former online communications director for the Republican National Committee, and other establishment figures in the party worried about Trump’s rise are forming a “self-styled guerrilla campaign” called Trump Card LLC. The group will be backed by anonymous donors with a goal to take down the front-runner.

On Saturday, Trump stormed Iowa with back-to-back rallies. The first, in Spencer, attracted an audience of 1,500. The second, in Davenport, had an audience of 2,500, according to the Trump campaign. For those in the audience still shopping around, seeing a negative ad against Trump from an establishment figure would almost certainly backfire.
“They got us into this mess, so why listen to them?” said Kim, a 49-year-old from Highland, Illinois.
“They’re the reason we’re in the state we’re in. It’s career politicians that don’t have my interests in mind,” Kim’s husband, Jeff, 49, said. “The more our people run negative ads against other people in our party, the more it makes me mad.”
Trump routinely presents himself to voters as an anti-establishment, outsider candidate, an image that supporters cite as being among their top reasons for backing him. That's one reason that negative advertisements against Trump may prove ineffective, according to Bloomberg Politics advertising analyst Ken Goldstein.
“If you believe that people are still shopping around and if you believe that all of these polls are simply measuring people who are not actually going to show up on a cold February night, then by advertising all you’re doing is mobilizing more people who wouldn’t vote anyway and are probably not going to vote for an establishment candidate regardless,” Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said.
Many voters in Davenport seemed to concur.
“I would probably want to vote for him more,” Mary, 45, from Wheatland, Iowa, said when asked about the effect of anti-Trump ads.
Goldstein does, however, say that negative advertising could hurt Trump in Iowa if it targets one specific group: evangelicals, who make up 60 percent of Iowa caucus-goers. Turning them against Trump by using targeted mailings might prove effective, Goldstein said, if the candidate's past positions on abortion rights and advocacy for a single-payer healthcare system were targeted.
“Why was advertising so devastating to Mitt Romney? Because at the end of the day Mitt Romney’s main message was ‘I’m a job creator’ while the Obama message was ‘No, you’re a job destroyer,’” Goldstein said. “If Trump’s big message is ‘I’m aggressive, I’m tough, I’m conservative,’ then saying things that don’t knock at his strengths may not matter.”
Voters who said they would not be swayed by ads that focus on Trump’s rhetoric on the trail would be more likely to look into whether the charges were true, Goldstein argues. Those in attendance at Trump's rallies over the weekend seemed to prove Goldstein's point.
“I think if I fact-checked it myself and looked into whatever negative aspect they are pointing out I would take that a lot more seriously,” Ryan, 30, from Silvis, Illinois, said.

The Hamilton Beach The Scoop Single-Serve Coffeemaker seemed like a good purchase for me when I first bought it. At that time I was convinced it would be a good idea since a lot of the times I waste coffee because I do not drink enough of it to have a full pot of coffee. However, on some mornings and especially on the weekends I drink at least three cups of coffee. I began regretting this purchase on those days when I drank more because I would have to wait for each individual cup to be made with the coffeemaker. I now always make enough coffee in my 12 cup coffeemaker for 3 cups. Simply measuring out the right amount, instead of for 12 cups works just fine. I may only drink one cup on some days, but I am barely wasting any now. The single serve coffeemaker now sits in my cupboard and is barely used.

"Home » General » The 5 Cardinal Sins of Marketing and How to Avoid Them November 9, 2015 The 5 Cardinal Sins of Marketing and How to Avoid Them
Marketing is both an art and a science, calling on an almost intuitive understanding of the consumer combined with measurement, evaluation and precision. When marketing efforts become detached from one or other of these roots, marketing activities are doomed to failure.
Marketers can sometimes become so absorbed in their marketing campaigns that they forget the importance of utilising rigorous analytics to measure, and then improve, results. On the other hand, other marketers can be so embedded in the marketing analytics that they get bogged down in data and lose sight of the consumer entirely.
Marketing might be essential, but unfortunately it only works if you’re doing it right… Bad marketing is no better than not marketing at all.
Here are the 5 most common traps that marketers fall into and how to skirt around them. 1. Not mapping the consumer journey
In other words, you need to know where your customers come from. Many businesses get so caught up chasing the sale that they forget to track where that sale has come from.
Imagine you want to buy a pair of jeans. You spend some time researching online, then you pop into store on your way home from work to try some on. You think on it overnight and then buy a pair via mobile app on your commute the next morning. Where did that sale come from?
Purchases are multi-channel decisions. In fact, Google found that 93% of mobile phone users research purchases from mobile (for a staggering 15+ hours a week) but the majority go on to complete the purchase elsewhere – in store, or from a desktop computer, for example.
It’s crucial that marketers map the consumer journey using multi-channel or cross-device tracking, in order to better understand the purchase funnel. Understanding the path your consumers take to find you, engage with you and then ultimately buy from you, allows you to identify which channels are working best for you and you can then tailor your marketing strategy accordingly.
By mapping the cross-channel consumer journey you get insight into where your marketing efforts are delivering the best ROI, meaning you can focus your marketing spend on the areas that deliver results. 2. Failing to prioritise pre-testing
When you’ve worked on the same thing for weeks, when you’ve got the ‘no time for sleep’ coffee shakes, when you finally have a brand new and shiny marketing campaign to roll out, the last thing you want to do is put the brakes on, hold off on launch and start testing. Of course it works, right? Look at how much time, energy and passion you’ve put into it.
The marketing industry moves fast, and that can sometimes put extraordinary pressure on marketers to keep up – but it’s a tortoise and the hare scenario. Testing is as critical to marketing as any of the other elements of your campaign. Amazing new website… but not converting? Brilliant e-commerce app… but nobody’s buying? Pre-testing allows you to identify any potential hitches in your marketing plan so you can work around them – before they’re live and it’s too little too late.
Maybe your website is brilliant … but your homepage is causing a log-jam. Maybe that app could be the next big thing… but no one can find the check out button. If you don’t test it, you don’t know.
Split testing, or A/B testing, is the solution. Split testing allows you to pre-test elements of your campaign by taking a small audience, splitting them, and showing them slightly different versions of your campaign. The key is to keep every element the same apart from one – so when the split audience give different results, you know those results are directly linked to the element you changed. For example, you could split-test your email marketing campaign by sending identical emails with different subject lines. The subject line with the highest open rate can be rolled out across your whole campaign. Think how many potential customers you’d have disengaged if you didn’t test and you went with the worst performing subject line?
Here’s the results of a recent subject line we split tested via open-rates:
By sending out the winning subject line, we achieved one of our highest click-through rates ever for an email campaign: 3. Ignoring telephone leads
A lot of marketers will focus their time and energy on website leads because they tend to be the leads you get most of. Quantity doesn’t equal quality though. Marketers have something to learn from salespeople on this – ask any salesperson which leads they prefer and they’ll always answer ‘the telephone’. Telephone leads convert more : Fact. 10 -15 times more, actually.
The tendency in the digital age is always to look forwards –the next piece of tech, the next social network, the next big thing – but the telephone shouldn’t be ignored. Telephone leads might be naturally fewer than website leads but they’re high quality, because they’re a captive and engaged audience. If someone calls you, you know you’ve got their attention. There aren’t 1001 browsers open; they aren’t playing Candy Crush Saga with one hand while browsing new TVs with the other.
Correctly harnessing telephone leads is critical to successful marketing – which means tracking them correctly, and integrating on and offline activity so their behaviour makes sense within a wider context. Call tracking tools from providers like Mediahawk are perfect, allocating each unique visitor to your site a unique telephone number and providing extensive call analytics once they’re on the phone. call tracking links up online and offline consumer activity, allowing marketers to understand their campaign holistically while providing sales people with better qualified leads. 4. Being data-blind
Like snow-blindness, data-blindness comes about through over-exposure. Analytics are the buzzword of the moment in many ways and we have an overload of information. Whether it’s click-rate or open rate, bounce rate or conversion rate, we measure anything and everything.
The real key to successful marketing is to work out which of these is relevant. Different businesses will find value in different metrics – simply measuring everything and hoping for the best isn’t enough. Data is only meaningful if we can interpret it, if it has tangible value for the business. Every marketer needs to define the KPIs that are meaningful for their campaign – which comes back to your initial marketing goals. Go back to what you’re trying to achieve and work out which metrics are best/most relevant for measuring success. 5. Losing sight of the consumer
Losing sight of the consumer is the cardinal marketing sin. Testing is one thing. Leads. Conversions. Data and more data. But at the centre of all of it is the consumer.
Marketers can often be guilty of assuming the consumer feels the same way about the brand as they do. It’s normal – when you live and breathe something, trying to imagine being on the other side of the fence can be difficult.
But the brand is what the consumer thinks it is – not what the brand says about itself.
Brand perception is one of the most important metrics to understand for marketers. At the heart of the purchasing decision is emotion. It’s emotion that drives the activity your behavioural metrics are showing – your likes, shares, and RTs are coming from an emotional interaction with your brand.
How your consumers think of, interact with and perceive your brand is absolutely critical to know – and informs your entire messaging strategy. You can have the most comprehensive understanding of lead source or conversion but without knowing your customer you won’t get your messaging right and without getting your messaging right, your marketing will miss the mark.
Really grasping this relies on attitudinal metrics – simple quantitative data can’t tell you how people feel about you. Surveys, focus groups and so on are the answer – interacting with your customer as a person, not a number.
Every business has its own unique demands but in all, effective marketing is that which is most closely aligned with the consumer. The consumer is at the heart of all marketing efforts – and successful marketing campaigns are those that test, track, measure, interpret, refine and seek to understand their consumer at every turn."

"Welcome to the team, Jacob Ward, our new Client Services Manager!

Jacob is an Arkansas native who served a brief stint in the Sunshine State while getting his master's degree in integrated marketing at Florida State University. He worked in education and in client management roles for two marketing/PR firms prior to joining DataRank.

In his own words this is why he's excited to work with DataRank/Simply Measured:

""Coming from the marketing/communications field, I know good data is the key to a successful future for most companies, period. That is, if they can make sense of it. I've seen that brands are starved for useful data that answers the questions they’re facing from today’s fast-changing consumer, and the fact that we’re able to provide insights and counsel that deliver results almost instantaneously is both impressive and incredibly valuable. I love seeing the aha moment when a client “gets it” and realizes how powerful the data in their hands is. And then, I like to celebrate the win. That’s why I'm here."""

"For any brand, reputation is everything—and reputations are often built (or torn down) with earned media . From a glowing news article about one of your products to that horrific Yelp review, every brand experiences the benefits and drawbacks of earned media.
And in today’s socially connected world, marketers are increasing their use of earned media as a contact marketing tactic as it continues to be a crucial factor in consumer decision making.
In fact, a study by Nielsen and InPowered shows that expert content—credible, third-party articles and reviews—is the most effective source of information in impacting consumers along all stages of the purchase process across product categories. The study also showed that earned media is 88 percent more effective than owned media content alone.
Definition of Earned Media Earned media, also referred to as media relations, word-of-mouth, PR or publicity, is an unpaid brand mention or recognition such as a news article, published interview, or online review by a third party. In addition, earned media can also refer to a byline or article written by someone associated with the brand that is published by a third party.
Earned media is one of three major marketing categories, with the other two being owned media and paid media . Owned media is any content created and managed by the brand such as a website or blog. Paid media is–as it sounds–any publicity, advertising, or content published by a third party that’s paid for by the brand. Many would call earned media the Holy Grail of the three media types, and often earned media is the result of your paid or owned efforts. (e.g. running a promotion (owned) on your website that results in people around the web talking about it (earned).)
These days, social media and review curation sites are major earned media platforms. Everything from that nice tweet about your fabulous customer service to Facebook shares to poor reviews on independent review sites is part of earned media. And viral content is probably the ultimate example of earned media.
Pros
As a content marketing tactic, earned media is one of the most affordable and impactful strategies that a marketer can take advantage of. Here are just some of the benefits of using earned media in your content marketing strategy:
Expert content allows brands are able to build reputation, credibility and trust with new customers, while reinforcing current customer relationships. Since credibility and trust are established, earned media also inspires customer action. Earned media is incredibly cost effective because it requires your time, not a large budget. Social signals such as likes and shares send positive juice to search engines and organic search results can be positively impacted. Cons
While earned media can be have a positive impact on your brand, it does have its drawbacks, too. Here are some of the disadvantages of earned media:
Since you don’t own the content, you can’t control the message—which can include negative press, reviews, and comments about your brand. Cultivating quality relationships with your customers and media outlets who cover your business is time consuming and doesn’t happen right away. Newsrooms are slimmer on editorial staff than ever and earning placements is also more difficult. The cost to pay a media relations firm for earned media in major publications does not bring a guarantee. What Experts Are Saying “Content is the currency for building social relationships with journalists and bloggers that can boost earned media. Companies that invest in content marketing through brand publisher models are able to attract more inbound media coverage due to their demonstrated expertise. Brand content also enables those same companies to bypass traditional media and connect with consumers directly.”
Lee Odden, CEO, TopRank Marketing
“Content marketing can be a powerful tool for brands, but the key is to ensure that the messaging is relevant and consistent to the brand narrative. Otherwise it can become extra noise in an already loud space.”
Mark Delcorps, Public Relations Manager at Overstock.com
“The earned strategy, or publicity gained through editorial influence, is something that has been around for awhile but has become more important due to the advent of social media. Not unlike earning coverage in an industry magazine article, gaining shares, ‘likes,’ re-tweets, posts, and every other social signal related to your business has become an important criteria for promoting your business’ authority. It provides Google with an opportunity to understand if your content is important and, in return, helps to move that content up higher in relevant search engine results pages (SERPs). Online earned media has taken the place of the “word-of-mouth” advertising we all coveted.”
Christopher Baldock, contributor to Content Marketing Institute. (Source: contentmarketinginstitute.com )
Brand Examples of Earned Media TopRank Marketing
TopRank Marketing CEO Lee Odden has established himself and the agency as thought leaders and innovators in content marketing. As a result, his expertise is often sought after for interviews, contributed articles and webinars. As an example, last year Lee participated in an interview with Content Standard by Skyword.
Budweiser
During the 2015 Super Bowl, Budweiser aired its “Brewed the Hard Way” advertisement that challenged the craft brewing industry a bit. The LA Times wrote an article titled “How the ‘Proud to be macro’ Budweiser Super Bowl ad got it all right.” Not only did the article make the beer company look great, but the LA Times is also a very trustworthy source. This is also a perfect example of earned media working with owned and paid media.
Copyblogger Media (client)
In early 2015, Copyblogger Media —a well-known content marketing software and training organization—was preparing for its second annual Authority Rainmaker conference. With the conference still in its early years, Copyblogger partnered with TopRank Marketing to create an eBook that would leverage event speakers to raise awareness and attract registrations for the event. Promotion of the eBook included several earned media guest posts to industry blogs such as Kapost, SlideShare, and Simply Measured.
Combining earned media with other content marketing tactics, the eBook had a total of 26,859 views, more than 1,000 shares, and 139 downloads. A total of 19 referrals were logged as assisted conversions, with an additional 4 direct conversions.
Earned Media Best Practices Create awesome, share-worthy content. Remember, content is king. Create quality, engaging content that serves a useful purpose. If you can address a paint point, provide valuable insights, or educate your audience, they’ll share. Build and nurture relationships. Reach out to publishers, editors, journalists, influencers, and any other relevant third-party. These are the people who can cover your business when a new product launches, as well as special events, industry news and so on. Be prepared to work on someone else’s deadline. Journalists and editors are always working on hard deadlines. Be prepared to speed up or delay your own efforts to fit with their needs. Earned media should be just one part of your content marketing strategy. Think about how your owned and paid media efforts can result in some earned media. For example, Coca-Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign that launched last summer was a huge multi-faceted campaign—that got a whole lot of people sharing photos of their Cokes on social media platforms. Share positive press and reviews. If people are saying awesome things about your brand, show people. Add customer reviews to your website and share on your social media pages. Software & Resources The following resources can help you connect with media organizations and journalists, craft quality content ideas, and track the publicity you’re getting on social media.

"10 Social Media Reporting Apps You Can’t Live Another Day Without Posted on admin Posted in News
Do you have a dedicated social media reporting app? If the answer is no, I have only one question for you: how are you getting through the day?!
Social media campaigns are no longer just a matter of posting links and offering news of specials. You need to really stand out, and that takes time, energy, and a ton of data. Not only for businesses, but just for blogs and personal brands as well. Without the proper information at your disposal, you don’t have a chance.
These are the ten social media reporting apps you can’t afford to go another day without using. SumAll : This isn’t just a social media dashboard, it is also an ecommerce monitoring tool. So if you want something more well rounded than analytics, it can be a great option for your business. it is all based around leads and conversions, unlike many other platforms that are purely about social growth. The two pronged approach makes it an effective tool for using social media in the way it is best utilized: as a way to build a customer base, not just your clout online. Agorapulse : Just need a simple (but good) social media manager? Agorapulse is compatible with three platforms: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Which are going to be the three primary social networks for most businesses anyway, given their ever growing list of features aimed at companies. You can get detailed reports, manage all messages from a single dashboard, and launch both contests and promotions customized to fit your needs. After the free trial pricing starts at $ 24 a month, with plans up to $ 199. But they also have three free tools: Facebook barometer, contest manager, and a Facebook Marketing University course. Sprout Social : One of the bigger names in social media analytics, Sprout Social is a complete management software that can be compared to other giants like Hootsuite. Used by many major brands, such as Dove and UPS, it covers all your social bases from planning, to scheduling, to posting, to analyzing. They have a smart inbox, live monitoring, tracking, social CRM, analytics, team collaboration, and other features you would expect from such a large scale dashboard. Pricing can be a bit steep, starting at $ 59 a month. But if you are running a branding campaign, it is worth it. Cyfe : This is probably the most impressive tool to come out in a long time. Cyfe is a full business monitoring platform that aims to handle literally every possible avenue of your online engagement and tasks from a single service. That includes social media, analytics, marketing, sales, customer support, and infrastructure. But what is more incredible is the price. The basic features are free, but you will want Premium. For $ 19 per month (or $ 14 if you pay annually), you get unlimited everything, and access to all of the monitoring software for what was listed above. Social Report : Just want social tracking? Social Report is a great metrics tool that shows all of your social accounts in cross-platform reports that show you progress on all of your projects. They also have team collaboration and backup tools, so you and your social team can track progress over time and make decisions accordingly. All of their plans also have wider web analytics, which can be helpful in giving you a fuller picture. Hootsuite is a mixed bag. On one hand, there is no denying it has become a powerhouse in analytics and social management. But it is also one of the more expensive, and the credit system it uses is annoying. For example, you get some very basic reports as part of Pro, but others have to be purchased with credits that can only be bought in bulk, and so cost hundreds to replenish. Not really an option for small operations. The good thing about it is the many features it provides. Their tools are very in depth, so much so that they have dozens of webinars exploring what can be done on their platform. Simply Measured is usually mentioned on lists less for their premium features, and more for their free tools. They have a long list of them, and are also one of the few platforms that offers monitoring capabilities for Google Plus and Vine. In fact, you can incorporate quite a lot of services in with their free tools, and end up with a great system without spending a penny. Which is good, because their premium tools start at $ 500 per month. They are a full social analytics and solutions company and tend to work with larger businesses as a result. If you can afford them, they are worth it. If not, their free tools are excellent. Raven is the marketer’s ultimate tool. While it has plenty of analytics features, scheduling and more, it is much more focused on creating extensive and beautiful reports that show clients and bosses how things are progressing. It is a social analytics tool made to make you, the marketer, look good. So while it is practice, it is also a bit of a job-justifier. Tailwind : Pinterest has been pretty stingy on sharing their API. They don’t want a lot of competition for their analytics and marketing tools, which are frankly not good enough to stand on their own, yet. Tailwind is the last standing Pinterest monitoring and marketing tool, and luckily it is a good one. It can also be integrated with Hootsuite using the third party app selection, so you can monitor it from there. Keyhole : Most people who use Keyhole know it for its real time hashtag tracking. But it also has historical data, influencer identification, and a few other features that make it a great platform for Twitter campaigns. They have short term campaigns available, which make it a unique monitoring tool, and attractive for special events like conventions that don’t need year round campaign management.
Bonus: More reporting and monitoring tools to use: Monitority: A cool free tool monitoring your site uptime. For uptime stats, check out this Industry stats page. WhoICompete keeps an eye on your competitors and how they move around Google SERPs Commun.it is a great monitoring tool keeping an eye on your most important Twitter interactions.

5 B2B Brands That Get People to Pay Attention Over the Holidays https://t.co/JqTe5Bws6N via @simplymeasured
"-We could start with this analysis that shows that the only thing standing between us and 100% renewable energy in the UK by 2050 is the will: https://100.org/100-goes-global-maps /
-We could do more to promote the excellent work by giant multinationals like Unilever and Coke (yes really) to decarbonise and transition to a circular economy.
-We could invest more in the research required to deal with our waste problems.
-We could roll out a program across our schools that teaches the next generation to think in terms of systems and interconnectivity rather than reductionism and linearity.
-We could incentivise and subsidise entrepreneurs who build restorative industrial practices into their business models.
-We could explore rewilding of our urban spaces, bringing Nature into our cities, making them not only more diverse and better for Nature but cleaner and more enjoyable for ourselves. (for an intro to how this might work, see here: http://goo.gl/mnTJI3 ) Note: urban bee populations are the healthiest in the country.
-We could stop measuring GDP and instead adopt a different measure of economic wellbeing that are more nuanced than simply measuring activity (after oil spoils, the local economies show a boost in GDP due to the need to clean up). Two possibilities are GNH (gross national happiness) and GPP (gross peaceful product, which excludes weapons manufacture and sales from being counted).
Those are a few ideas off the top of my head to get us started. For a modest investment of £100k and around a year, I could put together a first stage feasibility report and costing. Compared to the £6billion needed to renew trident, £100k is a drop in the ocean."

The fluid Toyota calls for is a fluid that meets the Dexron III specification. Every 30K miles would be a great interval. I would recommend a full synthetic fluid. If you have Mobil 1 ATF available, I would recommend that. READ the container to make sure that it lists the Dexron III specification. The Differential is mounted onto the side of the transmission assembly and uses the same size hex bit as the transmission pan drain plug. The differential shares the same fluid with the transmission and will be filled when you fill the transmission. However, by removing the differential drain plug, you will drain more of the old fluid out. Simply MEASURE the amound of fluid you drain out, and then add the same amount of NEW fluid to replace that (after installing the drain plugs, of course). This SAME fluid is the correct fluid to use in the power steering system also. This picture shows the location of the drain plugs on my 2003 Sienna with the 1MZFE 6 cylinder motor, your drain plug locations should be very similar.

"Hi everyone, this is going to seem like a nerdy post, but I had a rainy weekend with nothing else on
I will be doing the OLT in late September with two other guys and I am having trouble determining which sort of stove I should bring and therefore how much fuel to bring with it. I would like some advice on this and comments on the test I did below.
I have an MSR Pocket Rocket and an MSR Whisperlite. I got the Whisperlite to use in the snow but started using it more than the Pocket Rocket because refilling the fuel bottles with Shellite suits me better than buying new gas canisters. However I have only ever used either of them for a maximum of two nights in a row, for a maximum of 2 people, hence my uncertainty about how much fuel I will need.
Our menu will generally be something like the following:
(All for three people).
1. Tea/Coffee #1
2. Breakfast - Porridge (Bag of quick oats, not the tiny instant sachet kind, so some cook time required)
3. Lunch - flatbreads, cheese, salami, etc.
4. Tea/Coffee #2
5. Dinner - Either instant noodles or the Freeze-dried packaged meals, or alternating every second night.
6. Tea/Coffee #3
I performed the following test with the Whisperlite at home to simulate a day's stove use (Sydney in August, so I would need to allow more fuel for colder weather). This was all using the heat shield, a 2L MSR ""Base"" pot, and allowing over an hour between tests to allow the stove to cool completely so that I would have to prime it again properly the next time. I simply measured the volume of fuel at the beginning and end of the test to get the amount used.
1. Tea/Coffee #1
Water Quantity: 3 x 450mL cups = 1,350mL
Burn Time: 5 mins
2. Breakfast - Porridge
Water Quantity: 750mL (one metric cup each) plus half cup of oats
Burn Time: 3 mins, 30 secs (including boil plus cook time)
3. Tea/Coffee #2
Water Quantity: 3 x 450mL cups = 1,350mL
Burn Time: 5 mins
4. Dinner - Instant Noodles
Water Quantity: 2,000mL (full MSR pot)
Burn Time: 6 mins, 30 secs
(Freeze-dried meals usually only require about 1,500mL or less, so they would use less fuel than the noodles).
5. Tea/Coffee #3
Water Quantity: 3 x 450mL cups = 1,350mL
Burn Time: 5 mins
Total fuel used: 200mL per day = 1,200mL Shellite
Total water boiled: 6.8L per day = 40.8L Water
Total burn time: 25 mins per day = 150 minutes
So this would require us to carry, at a minimum 1 x 887mL fuel bottle and 1 x 325mL fuel bottle, and that doesn't allow extra for the coldness factor or any extra needed in emergencies.
Does this test seem to correlate with people's experience on here? Is that really how much fuel I will need? It does seem a fair bit more than the table I found in MSR's article here: http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/blog/stoves-101-how-much-fuel-should-i-carry/ which states 1.3L of water per ounce of fuel for the Whisperlite, which comes to 32 ounces. Their biggest bottle is 30 ounces (887mL) so I would still need an additional smaller bottle. Does this mean I am not operating the Whisperlite efficiently.
On the other hand, the link above states 2L of water per ounce of fuel for the Pocket Rocket (which comes to 21 ounces, so I would need 3 x 8oz (227g) canisters. This seems like it would be lighter.
So if I assume that my test was valid and I haven't been screwing up my calculations, the choice is between:
a) MSR Whisperlite Stove = 410g (packed weight)
1 x 887mL MSR Liquid Fuel Bottle + 207g bottle = 1,094g (using 1mL = 1g, it's probably less)
1 x 325ml MSR Liquid Fuel Bottle + 79g bottle = 404g (again using 1mL = 1g)
Total = 1,908g
b) MSR Pocket Rocket Stove: 119g
3 x 227g canisters = 3 x 374g (gross weight) = 1,122g
Going by all this, I should go with the Pocket Rocket for weight efficiency. I am fully aware that there are many areas above where I could have screwed this all up. I would be grateful for any thoughts or advise any of you have on this!"

"Welcome to the team, Joel Ponce, our new Senior Account Manager!

Joel has been an active member in the NWA community serving as the emcee for TEDxFayetteville, Organizer for Startup Weekend, and Artinfusion Ambassador at Crystal Bridges. He is coming to us from Saatchi & Saatchi X where he delivered shopper marketing initiatives for major CPG brands.

He is passionate about sports, particularly soccer and loves learning about different cultures through traveling. Once upon a time he even ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain and lived to share the story - ask him about it.

In his own words this is why he's excited to work with DataRank/Simply Measured:

""The ability to access and leverage what people are saying online, in real-time, about any topic, anywhere in the world is incredibly useful and exciting. This is a product I believe in and see immense value in for clients across industries and geographies. I’m excited to work with clients to leverage our capabilities to meet their objectives.

"You are here: Home / Marketing / 10 Social Media Reporting Apps You Can’t Live Another Day Without 10 Social Media Reporting Apps You Can’t Live Another Day Without December 28, 2015 by Jessy Troy Leave a Comment
Do you have a dedicated social media reporting app? If the answer is no, I have only one question for you: how are you getting through the day?!
Social media campaigns are no longer just a matter of posting links and offering news of specials. You need to really stand out, and that takes time, energy, and a ton of data. Not only for businesses, but just for blogs and personal brands as well. Without the proper information at your disposal, you don’t have a chance.
These are the ten social media reporting apps you can’t afford to go another day without using. SumAll : This isn’t just a social media dashboard, it is also an ecommerce monitoring tool. So if you want something more well rounded than analytics, it can be a great option for your business. it is all based around leads and conversions, unlike many other platforms that are purely about social growth. The two pronged approach makes it an effective tool for using social media in the way it is best utilized: as a way to build a customer base, not just your clout online. Agorapulse : Just need a simple (but good) social media manager? Agorapulse is compatible with three platforms: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Which are going to be the three primary social networks for most businesses anyway, given their ever growing list of features aimed at companies. You can get detailed reports, manage all messages from a single dashboard, and launch both contests and promotions customized to fit your needs. After the free trial pricing starts at $24 a month, with plans up to $199. But they also have three free tools: Facebook barometer, contest manager, and a Facebook Marketing University course. Sprout Social : One of the bigger names in social media analytics, Sprout Social is a complete management software that can be compared to other giants like Hootsuite. Used by many major brands, such as Dove and UPS, it covers all your social bases from planning, to scheduling, to posting, to analyzing. They have a smart inbox, live monitoring, tracking, social CRM, analytics, team collaboration, and other features you would expect from such a large scale dashboard. Pricing can be a bit steep, starting at $59 a month. But if you are running a branding campaign, it is worth it. Cyfe : This is probably the most impressive tool to come out in a long time. Cyfe is a full business monitoring platform that aims to handle literally every possible avenue of your online engagement and tasks from a single service. That includes social media, analytics, marketing, sales, customer support, and infrastructure. But what is more incredible is the price. The basic features are free, but you will want Premium. For $19 per month (or $14 if you pay annually), you get unlimited everything, and access to all of the monitoring software for what was listed above. Social Report : Just want social tracking? Social Report is a great metrics tool that shows all of your social accounts in cross-platform reports that show you progress on all of your projects. They also have team collaboration and backup tools, so you and your social team can track progress over time and make decisions accordingly. All of their plans also have wider web analytics, which can be helpful in giving you a fuller picture. Hootsuite is a mixed bag. On one hand, there is no denying it has become a powerhouse in analytics and social management. But it is also one of the more expensive, and the credit system it uses is annoying. For example, you get some very basic reports as part of Pro, but others have to be purchased with credits that can only be bought in bulk, and so cost hundreds to replenish. Not really an option for small operations. The good thing about it is the many features it provides. Their tools are very in depth, so much so that they have dozens of webinars exploring what can be done on their platform. Simply Measured is usually mentioned on lists less for their premium features, and more for their free tools. They have a long list of them, and are also one of the few platforms that offers monitoring capabilities for Google Plus and Vine. In fact, you can incorporate quite a lot of services in with their free tools, and end up with a great system without spending a penny. Which is good, because their premium tools start at $500 per month. They are a full social analytics and solutions company and tend to work with larger businesses as a result. If you can afford them, they are worth it. If not, their free tools are excellent. Raven is the marketer’s ultimate tool. While it has plenty of analytics features, scheduling and more, it is much more focused on creating extensive and beautiful reports that show clients and bosses how things are progressing. It is a social analytics tool made to make you, the marketer, look good. So while it is practice, it is also a bit of a job-justifier. Tailwind : Pinterest has been pretty stingy on sharing their API. They don’t want a lot of competition for their analytics and marketing tools, which are frankly not good enough to stand on their own, yet. Tailwind is the last standing Pinterest monitoring and marketing tool, and luckily it is a good one. It can also be integrated with Hootsuite using the third party app selection, so you can monitor it from there. Keyhole : Most people who use Keyhole know it for its real time hashtag tracking. But it also has historical data, influencer identification , and a few other features that make it a great platform for Twitter campaigns. They have short term campaigns available, which make it a unique monitoring tool, and attractive for special events like conventions that don’t need year round campaign management.
Bonus: More reporting and monitoring tools to use: Monitority : A cool free tool monitoring your site uptime. For uptime stats, check out this Industry stats page. WhoICompete keeps an eye on your competitors and how they move around Google SERPs Commun.it is a great monitoring tool keeping an eye on your most important Twitter interactions.

Been following this discussion for 3 pages now in case there's something I too can learn but have to admit I must be missing something here - as suggested, why not just power up the inverter and measure it's output to determine it's design?
Partly because I wanted to figure this out before I wired it up into its final position. Mostly, however, because it wasn't (isn't?) clear to me that simply measuring 0V between neutral and ground is sufficient evidence. It's certainly a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one? That is, any two unrelated pieces of metal that I poke will generally measure 0V, so does it prove anything? Certainly a non-zero measurement would be strong evidence against bonding, but why is the inverse true?
On the other hand, the ohmmeter measurement seems like positive evidence in favor of bonding.
Quote: :
No, it's not adequate to just use and ohmmeter.
The only way you will know for sure is if you measure voltage. Many inverters have a internal switchable bond. Meaning, when on shore power the inverter bond is open and when using inverter the neutral-to-ground bond is made.
Right - I was aware of that, but that would simply mean that a ""non-connection"" measurement when off doesn't exclude bonded GN when running. In this case I measured no resistance when off, so it is apparently bonded when off, and there is no pass-through or anything else on this model, so am I wrong in assuming it must be bonded full time?"

"; News Feed Item Simply Measured Acquires Social Intelligence Technology Leader DataRank; Solidifies Position as the De Facto Analytics Solution for Social Marketers Simply Measured Closes Deal With DataRank to Help Social Marketers Research New Market Opportunities and Measure the Performance of Their Social Marketing Activities October 13, 2015 09:00 AM EDT Blog This
SEATTLE, WA--(Marketwired - October 13, 2015) - Simply Measured ( www.simplymeasured.com ), the leading social media analytics solution, today announced the acquisition of social intelligence provider, DataRank ( www.datarank.com ). DataRank, is an emerging leader in the social intelligence space helping marketers derive key insights from social data and online conversations. The DataRank deal marks the second recent acquisition for Simply Measured, who added social attribution and ROI provider Inside Socia l to its roster in August. The combination of social measurement inclusive of social ROI, and DataRank's social intelligence technology gives Simply Measured the most comprehensive analytics solution in the fast-growing social measurement market.
""We have proven the importance of social intelligence by helping leading enterprise brands research, discover and take action on their most important social conversations,"" said DataRank CEO, Ryan Frazier. ""The partnership with Simply Measured gives us the ability to help marketers through all of their critical campaign stages, from research, to measurement, to justifying ROI after the fact. We're excited for this new chapter and looking forward to helping marketers and insights professionals do their best work, simply.""
According to 'The Right Way To Measure Social Marketing,' a September 2015 report from Forrester Research, 53 percent of social relationship marketers surveyed listed measurement as among their top problem area when running branded social accounts, far beyond any other issue.As brands make significant investments in social, marketers are required to utilize data to drive decisions, yet few solutions exist to provide them with the data and insights they need. Most social marketing solutions focus on streamlining the execution process, with analytics as an afterthought, leaving the biggest challenges unresolved. Marketers need advanced measurement and attribution to show ROI and optimize performance. Successful data-driven marketing requires analytics tools that combine advanced measurement and social intelligence to enable better execution or campaigns.
""The main struggle for marketers today is how to find, understand and leverage data to improve campaign performance for their brand,"" stated Simply Measured CEO, Adam Schoenfeld. ""Basing campaign decisions on passive listening and vanity metrics is no longer enough to show social ROI or justify the investment to CMOs. Marketers need real social intelligence and research to discover new opportunities, understand online conversation, and take action. By adding DataRank to the Simply Measured family, we're providing marketers with a solution for every step of the process, from researching new opportunities, to attributing ROI, to measuring campaign success.""
The acquisition comes after a year of growth for DataRank, a Y-Combinator company, who grew their customer base by 150 percent over the past year. It also marks a banner year for Simply Measured, who was named one of the fastest growing companies by the Inc. 500 and also completed two key acquisitions in 2015.
The Simply Measured =LIFT(Social, 2015) conference marks the first time the DataRank and Simply Measured teams will discuss future integrations of their award-winning solutions, and will take place on October 22, 2015 at the Bell Harbor Convention Center in Seattle, Washington. Attendees can expect to hear from Ryan Frazier, CEO of DataRank and learn about Simply Measured's path to innovation from CEO, Adam Schoenfeld. Other speakers include representatives from Twitter, Forrester Research, Anheuser-Busch, TechCrunch and Alaska Airlines. For more information on the =LIFT conference, click here .

"How the Democratic Candidates Stacked Up Last Night With Twitter Mentions Sanders and Clinton in a dead heat By Christopher Heine October 14, 2015, 2:59 PM EDT Technology Bernie Sanders (l.) and Hillary Clinton sparred at the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. Getty Images After last night's five-candidate Democratic debate, most media pundits said former secretary of state Hillary Clinton won—while a CNN-led Facebook poll gave the victory to Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont. So we asked Simply Measured to mine Twitter data for a snapshot of which candidate the platform's users were buzzing about most. And the numbers jibe with the larger narrative—that whether Clinton or Sanders took the debate is probably up for, well, debate. Here is how the presidential hopefuls stacked up when it came to ""@mentions,"" which signify whenever one of the candidates was tweeted at by another Twitter user. In addition to Clinton and Sanders, the results below include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee: Clinton just edged out Sanders in this social-media matchup, and the other candidates are likely in trouble. Debate moderator Anderson Cooper, with 47,369 @mentions, garnered more buzz than O'Malley, Webb and Chafee. At any rate, this two-horse race probably won't conclude for months.

If establishment Republicans think that running negative television advertisements will quell the wave of support for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, Midwest voters say they should think again.
While waiting for Trump to arrive for a rally in Davenport, Iowa, on Saturday, voters who say they are still weighing their options said they would either not be swayed or be more likely to support the billionaire if they were to see negative ads on their televisions bashing the GOP front-runner.
More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Says Political Correctness Helped Enable California Attack
“If anything, I think it’ll stir up Trump’s base more and maybe engage them more,” Curt Anderson, a 20-year-old from Orion, Illinois, said.
Brenda Wolf, 70, from Bettendorf, Iowa, who has still not decided who to vote for, said negative ads would not change her mind. “That has nothing to do with us,” she said. As she pointed to the Trump podium in front of her, she added, “This has everything to do with us.”
In recent weeks, as Trump continues to lead in the polls and the Republican establishment grows more anxious about his potential to ultimately become the party’s nominee, negative ads targeting the real estate mogul have begun cropping up.
More from Bloomberg.com: Cruz, Gaining on Trump in Iowa, Intensifies War Rhetoric
Ohio Governor John Kasich’s super-PAC, New Day for America, has already invested $2.5 million in hostile ads on television, radio, online, and through direct mail. Earlier this year, a Club for Growth super-PAC spent $1 million in Iowa on ads attacking Trump.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCQhBYEMRQI
But those efforts do not seem to be piercing Trump’s Teflon coating, as he continues to hold a commanding lead in national and early-state polling.
In November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Liz Mair, the former online communications director for the Republican National Committee, and other establishment figures in the party worried about Trump’s rise are forming a “self-styled guerrilla campaign” called Trump Card LLC. The group will be backed by anonymous donors with a goal to take down the front-runner.

On Saturday, Trump stormed Iowa with back-to-back rallies. The first, in Spencer, attracted an audience of 1,500. The second, in Davenport, had an audience of 2,500, according to the Trump campaign. For those in the audience still shopping around, seeing a negative ad against Trump from an establishment figure would almost certainly backfire.
“They got us into this mess, so why listen to them?” said Kim, a 49-year-old from Highland, Illinois.
“They’re the reason we’re in the state we’re in. It’s career politicians that don’t have my interests in mind,” Kim’s husband, Jeff, 49, said. “The more our people run negative ads against other people in our party, the more it makes me mad.”
Trump routinely presents himself to voters as an anti-establishment, outsider candidate, an image that supporters cite as being among their top reasons for backing him. That's one reason that negative advertisements against Trump may prove ineffective, according to Bloomberg Politics advertising analyst Ken Goldstein.
“If you believe that people are still shopping around and if you believe that all of these polls are simply measuring people who are not actually going to show up on a cold February night, then by advertising all you’re doing is mobilizing more people who wouldn’t vote anyway and are probably not going to vote for an establishment candidate regardless,” Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said.
Many voters in Davenport seemed to concur.
“I would probably want to vote for him more,” Mary, 45, from Wheatland, Iowa, said when asked about the effect of anti-Trump ads.
Goldstein does, however, say that negative advertising could hurt Trump in Iowa if it targets one specific group: evangelicals, who make up 60 percent of Iowa caucus-goers. Turning them against Trump by using targeted mailings might prove effective, Goldstein said, if the candidate's past positions on abortion rights and advocacy for a single-payer healthcare system were targeted.
“Why was advertising so devastating to Mitt Romney? Because at the end of the day Mitt Romney’s main message was ‘I’m a job creator’ while the Obama message was ‘No, you’re a job destroyer,’” Goldstein said. “If Trump’s big message is ‘I’m aggressive, I’m tough, I’m conservative,’ then saying things that don’t knock at his strengths may not matter.”
Voters who said they would not be swayed by ads that focus on Trump’s rhetoric on the trail would be more likely to look into whether the charges were true, Goldstein argues. Those in attendance at Trump's rallies over the weekend seemed to prove Goldstein's point.
“I think if I fact-checked it myself and looked into whatever negative aspect they are pointing out I would take that a lot more seriously,” Ryan, 30, from Silvis, Illinois, said.

1937 and made in Italy and being used..that most likely means that this amp has had Benito Mussolini yellin through it. Think about it... I´l Duce himself,and... ! 1937. As some of you know i´m no stranger to the odd n peculiar when it comes to toobers. This time out tho...the full 9yrds. Out of the ballpark cool.
...well i´d hate turning this into a political thread by any means,but us being musicians..it´s most likely we´re not of the same notions Il Duce was. In fact,on the contrary. Those of us old enough recall...""This machine kills fascists""...and indeed...stay with me...
I´ve touched on the work of John Geloso previously. Please have in mind when this amp was made. The thing here is that the then ""new"" 6L6 tubes..were most likely a net result of John having spent time in the US as an employee of GE amongst others in the -20s and..well...he is by some, in retrospect, regarded as cutting edge at the time. An electrical genius even.
So.
Amp sports 6L6´s. Cool enough,and what´s more..all good right.?
Well. It gets better. Back in the day most amps produced were so called ""all current"" ones. Mains in various countries varied a LOT and could be anything from 100VDC to 220VAC. This well into the -50´s in some areas. What most ""all current"" amps had in common were that most of them lacked a mainstransformer. In short,no galvanic separation between the amp and the mains net=downright lethal.
In turn many a such amp had their chassis at potential. Ie;the actual chassis had voltage at it=downright lethal. Hence why old radios use plastic or whatever knobs and them cool cabs they do.
Well.
What makes the G.27 worthwhile is that..it uses an adjustable mains transformer and what´s more..chassis is ""zero"" alright. Atop that...
..the amp uses 6,3VAC for heaters,which by all means was no ""standard"" of the time either.
Atop that..it of course sports a phaseinverter...just...the PI is a...transformer . That in turn brings that it becomes way easier to push more current,at will,vs the powertubes..which are regular 6L6´s.
HELLO!!!!
So. What we´ve got here...is a SEVENTY EIGHT year old amp that will be the platform for a rocknroll machine that indeed....""kills fascists""
So nah.
Your plexi marshall TBH ain´t cool worth of one yota even. Sorry.
One Geloso G.27 hotrod for guitar use comin up!

The eagle...landed
Most anal packaging i´ve ever seen! For the better as the package was ""lost"" for about a week in transit.
All the foam and what not removed...yep. It sure arrived in one piece. That wiring heading to the left is up front...B+,ground n heaters..and at the back speaker out
Guess safety was regarded different back then huh!
Now. As it turns out there were versions G.28 and G.29 too and these were basically more involved amps. Involved in as much that there were more preamp possibilitys. In the case of this G.27 then..they opted to install that little box to the left there...which contained...
...a 6SJ7 pentode! Seing that this amp was made back in -37 and that the 6SJ7 is a -40s tube..that there is an add-on. Hotrodding if you will
The 6SJ7 being able to put out a whopping 2.5 watts of power if need be!
Then. To what use in this case really? Well..it´s there at least,so..i´ll keep it for future use.
Point being that G.27 as noted CAN be ""modernized"" to todays standards..something that can certainly NOT be said for other amps of the time!
The actual preamp is by tubes so old that they really are obsolete. Type 77 and 76. The former being the entry tube.
This in turn then the real gems. A pair of REALLY old 6L6G´s and the 5Z3 rectifier.
But..let´s stop here for a sec. What made the amp sport stuff like that?
Well. John Geloso was by many considered sort of an electronics wizz kid. As such he left for the states at a rather early state and was employed by General Electric amongst others. Him being a wiz kid tho..seems to have gotten bored easily and eventually said bye-bye to the US and moved back to Milano..where he opened shop. Geloso Inc.
Hence the use of the,then,rather avant garde tubes like 6L6 and 5Z3. The latter all said a done a tube rectifier with a rather hefty voltage drop but..ample capacity as far as power.
For better for worse that APE cool mA dial turns out to be an add-on too. Please be aware that this amp sport NO fuses what so ever. Hence..it from time to time might be a good idea to check status via that dial there.. (like that´d help!!)
´N here the inside of it all. The amp meter and then a dial to click it in n out of business.
Then for the outside of same dial.
Under a small lid resides the voltage selector. Be aware that at the time wall voltage could be basically anything around Europe.. You swap taps for the PT by physically bolting that bracket to the desired bung.
As with basically any Geloso that there is speaker out. Working your way through the amp it turns out that a few bits n pieces stay put as far as being Geloso..to the -50´s...to the -70´s amps...
Here in turn a socket to run add-on devices. B+,ground and heaters...
Now. That some really beutiful ol´glass! The 77 tube being a top anode fed tube obviously.
..and here we go. The mere SIZE of the internal components is history,sorta. That MEGA resistor to the left..is a sort of pulldown. It´s of 12k total,and g2 out is set via the slider. Rendering approx 2k before g2 out.
If you look the schem up..this thing is biased a little different. An array of chokes is used to provide g1 with negative voltage. The actual bias in turn is set by altering that slider. By increasing or decreasing g2 voltage...you alter bias. Cool huh!?
That said. Have in mind that we´re talking 1937 here. The amp sports a starground for instance.
As can be seen a few component HAS been replaced. This done before the JMP was an itch on Jims sack tho...
The preamp. The REAL complex preamp... Love the use of shower hose to act as shield for a cap...
Yep. The ""tono"" dial doubles as on/off switch.
Here a blow up of that wonderful wound resistor. It WAS broken tho..a quick fix handled that...
Just SEE the mere size of that PT!!! Drop that thing on your foot and you might as well just cut it off! DAAYYYYUM that´s one serious powertransformer!
A few of the tubes holds these small pieces of tape at their sockets. Written with ink...it says,in german,that the tube was last checked for integrity back in 1961. Vintage anyone? Anyone thinking their Plexi is old?
Ah! The beuty n the beast at the same time. The grandmama of all 6L6 tubes. This is where it all started boys!
Us made components. Yeah. That there is the working end of that small ""black box"" that contained that 6SJ7. See..later on Geloso made their own caps and what have you not. At the time tho..no,and seing Johns former employment. Well...
For some reason tho it seems that the other e-lytes are of some defunct old french brand? Might be canadian too i suppose? Anyone out there with info,please voice up!
Well. Me being me i was about as anxious as an 8yr old on x-mas eve..so i took to installing at least ONE fuseholder right off the bat. Then replaced the mains wire with a three prong one.
Sans the 5Z3 i fired her up after a thorough visual checkup. Sure enough. The PT is alive. However..i saw a whopping ~560VAC between each tap and ground! That some SERIOUS voltage right there!
Well.
Took to repairing that mega resistor..and cut everything else outta there rendering that what i had at hand was a B+ line with a massive resistor of 12k vs ground and a pair of fresh 450V caps in series just to be safe and....
Fire in the hole!
Yes. The thing works. The 5Z3 ramped up REAL quick,especially seing its age,and B+ came in at approx 490VDC. Not to shabby!
That´s were i left it for the day tho.
Il Duce. Phase one has been covered.
Il Duce. Rocknroll edition..coming up.
Stay tuned

Me and my mentor in all of this,Aleks,spent a little time with the amp after closing shop last night.
For those so inclined. Check the schem out above. Try to figure out how this thing´s biased.
Altho the schem is rather rudementry looking...make no mistake. This was designed by John Geloso see.. I´ll give ya a hint. Bias voltage is present cold...but won´t rise until the powertubes start digesting power...
We stood there with the amp before us,checking everything in sight out to figure the thing out. First up it turned out that the inductance between the CT vs bias out was shot.
Turned out to be the insulation of the wiring that was chafed..so replaced the wires and done deal. That done,and with the powertubes out,we saw approx negative 6.5VDC.
That inductance there...is of a DC resistance of approx 6,5k and in turn approx 150H.
The inductance between the CT and ground OTOH...didn´t check that out beyond just measuring DC resistence vs ground.
So. That deal there works. Simple as that. In turn bias is adjustable by moving the stainless steel slider on that gigantic ceramic wound resistor...and thus altering voltage vs g2. That way you hand g2 a varying potential and hence..make the tubes more or less active in idle. Smooth setup!
I´ll ask you a favour here tho. Take to heart when this amp was made. Try to wrap your mind around what led to the bias setup solution.
That some serious thinking right there boys,and that in an era when ""electronics"" were in its infancy.
Impressive,to say the least.
So?
Whatta we got here? Well. After replacing a few caps within the powerstage we indeed DO have ourselves a stable powerstage in idle. We opted to measure bias by the ""shunt method"",Ie-by measuring DC resistence of the outputtransformer between each tap and CT and then simply measure voltage drop across it...Ohms laws asf...
All said and done the amp came to rest at approx 425VDC...and at that rate we saw approx 25w per tube omitted. IOW a little high for the old original 6L6G tubes...but we had installed a pair of old Sovtek 5881´s for trials...all things considered so no harm no foul.
To reinstall the old glass tho...bias needs to come down a bit as they´re rated at 19 watts a pop maximum and seing their age and the negative grid bias setup...i´d really like to see them come to rest around the 14-15w mark or so.
No matter. As we´ve got ourselves one powerstage up n running...next up is to in the most rudementry of ways freshen the preamp up to be able to play the thing ( ) and in turn..measure various voltages. AC such especially as that´ll hand us a ballpark figure as far as what to shoot for when we eventually swap preamp tubes for something more up to date.
I´ll tell you what tho. Last night..you could about HEAR the wings of time... Absolutely fantastic!

So.
It has spoken.
Impressions are...it´s real quiet in idle. Sound out of it is a little dull,but OH is it ever powerful the old amp!
Now for some serious thinking i guess,what to do with it.
Racing 110 Joined: Sat Dec 07, 2013 2:29 pm Top Re: Seriously. Out of the ballpark cool by Racing » Fri Sep 04, 2015 1:23 am
Spent a number of hrs just playing the darn thing. Evaluating it.
Came to fool around a bit with the PI setup with the intent of letting top end back in,to no avail.
Summary is that this thing needs work. 1st up is to replace the entire PI setup with a more ""regular"" tube ditto. Seing the issue at hand,the lack of any and all top end,and the lack of flexibility of the stock design the reasonable conclusion is...to replace the PI setup.
For instance..
I played around a bit with the value of those two feedback caps of 25nF (now 22nF) and that certainly helped,but before i got to the point where i saw point of diminishing return bias turned instable. No wonder once you understand the setup.
Don´t get me wrong. The idea here is NOT one of a 5150 contender. None the less the amp has to be of practical use all said n done and ATM..it is not.
Friend reasoned as such that one mans trash,another mans gold...more directly in that it might be a cool amp for harmonica. (Seing the lack of top end)
Yeah.
It might,but what harmonica player in his right mind would tout a 25kg head around..capable of approx 50 watts total or so (it runs in AB2 BTW)
Nah. All said n done...with the UTMOST respect for John Geloso and his original intent...this one needs t a LOT of work.
So. Spending all that time playin it...evaluating it,yesterday...didn´t make it any easier arriving on a decision. What i´m saying is that for hrs at end i weighed back n forth..and after a lot of soulsearching arrived on the only reasonable conclusion,in my opinion.
That said next natural step is to decide on which route to take-seing the vintage of the amp. Again..""5150"" contender is bluntly and simply out.
I guess what i´m saying is that for once it´d be an idea to keep my head cool. Trying to stay with the origins and basic idea of the amp effectively and truly making it into a ""hotrod"".
Racing 110 Joined: Sat Dec 07, 2013 2:29 pm Top Re: Seriously. Out of the ballpark cool by Racing » Fri Sep 04, 2015 1:24 am
That said.
The idea here is a usable amp. As stated 5150 ideas are friggin out,but we need to be able to use the thing. In turn..NONE intrusive mods are ok. Drilling the occasional smaller hole..sure,but violating the thing-no. Or more to the point HELL no!
So.
Took to removing the sockets for the 77 and 76 tube,replacing them with novals. In turn populated a board with components needed,and presto..we´ve got the innards for an amp that will deliver what we ask of it.
All good,but rather generic.
So. Amp had been modded previously with a 6SJ7 upfront right...and albeit that tube being later then the actual amp..it sure has been in there since stonehenge and..well.
What if?
Or more to the point,friggin LETS!
Now. As i will not under any circumstance drill into the old amp,apart from the drilled to swiss cheese faceplate, that left me with the holes already there right. So..that 6SJ7 will be hidden by the rather large ""can"" that sits atop the trafos as the hole unused was right next to the OT. OTOH,the drilled to smithereens ""faceplate"" is another matter.
Well. Stay tuned boys
...to be continued...

Disregard the rather temporary plate to the left for the jacks. Just needed a place to put them meanwhile.
The undressed faceplate really looks like crap,and ..it needs to be adressed. Idea here is to keep with the original idea of the amp,taking its age into consideration,safety factors,practical considerations..asf asf asf.
Not an easy task as it turns out.
Some of the holes drilled are really unsightly ugly. Made with a dull drillbit and the worst of practice.
As i´m basically replacing everything within,down to the wire bundles,for safety reasons...i took to replacing the sockets too.
Yup. Replaced the No76 and No77 tubes with more current offerings. As it turns out the novals was a direct fit into the existing holes.
However. Them stock ""screen caps"" for the stock tubes are installed on separate ""rims"" that are bolted to the chassis,and thus..can be installed over the small novals too thereby keeping the looks of the unit stock.
Yup.
Then in turn. At the far end of the chassis,hidden by the ""hood"" there´s ample room for an octal or two. As the amp was delivered with an add-on 6SJ/ pentode i reasoned as such that..why the hell not.
With the hood installed the 6SJ7 together with the trafos will be hidden from plain sight,but noticed...oh TRUST me on that one
Yup. Neat n orderly fashion. No more of that hip-hap...
´N of course a minimum of fuses were added.
Mains reside at the rear face,and the two ones in the pic are for HT and heaters.
At first i thought i was out of luck replacing the socket for the 5Z3. As it turns out..they use regular 300B sockets! There ya go.
Seing how the rest of it is brand new...that there got replaced too.
Then.
The faceplate. Something needed to be done and i reasoned around this for friggin DAYS. I wanted to keep with the stock design and general idea of the amp,i wanted to be respectful of the amps age...i needed the faceplate to be of practical worth...and most imperative of all..safety needed to be readressed.
That for instance,as far as faceplate,ment a double pole mains switch and a pilot light.
Talked it over with a LOT of people and arrived at....
That there. Came to use a 1mm thick anodized piece of sheetmetal cut to size. The fasteners,philips screws,will be replaced with something way less new n shiny..as they IMO kind of looks like soar eye put in context,but i´m happy with the design and outcome as a whole.
The 2.5mm predrilled hole beneath the mains switch...pilotlight...and i´m gonna reuse an old ""european"" lens made for the task.
Spent a lot of time debating the No of dials that i absolutely needed to pull this off,and arrived at 6pcs...no matter what. Of course i could have used ""twin"" pots but...nah.
The knobs are the stockers for the Farfisa i just did and TBH i think they melt into it rather well.
The mA meter i´m going to wire to be able to see anode loss in idle,at least along my current thinking.
With any luck..this thing´ll roar for the first time in its new guise come tonight and i SINCERLY hope Benito turns in his friggin grave!

Gentlemen. We have lift-off,and FOR a lift off!
Hooked to the wilder one of the two input jacks,which engages a 6SJ7 atop the two triodes of a 6n2p,...and then you dial the thing conservative..we´ve got instant Malcolm Young! No lie.
The thing j st barely runs into crunch and you can alter how much very effectively by simply being more,or less,nasty on the strings.
REAL happy with this first trial!
Sound per above is friggin liquid magic!
Now..still needs work..and i´m going all in this time. Brings that the cab will see some attention too time permitting.
Racing 110 Joined: Sat Dec 07, 2013 2:29 pm Top Re: Seriously. Out of the ballpark cool by Racing » Fri Sep 04, 2015 1:36 am
Well....that escalated quickly.
Thought i´d move the amp from where it was at atop the MAX speaker box over to the bench...to unhook that 12k powerresistor used for pulldown... So. Unhook all the wires right..grab the amp,and as i walk over to the bench i turn it around to have a look and....*BOOM*
Right.
One old 5Z3 in a million pieces on the floor.
Curtains.
See. The point was that i wanted to try that out before tonights rehearsal with one of the bands i play in...and 1.5hrs before takeoff...ya simply don´t dig a 5Z3 up in that time.
Or?
No. No you don´t,but good friend Aleks had the equivalent on the shelf. A 5U4G. Only difference is that the latter takes an octal socket instead.
So. Said n done..
Yep. All said and done...same same,and indeed B+ touched down a few volts plus vs the 5Z3,but that was it.
Iow..i had time to spare to check that there with removing the pulldown resistor. ´N yeah. You could get away with it i guess,but due to the characteristics of the choke at the PT´s centertap asf...i saw inxs of 600VDC for a few seconds before the powertubes start to digest what they need and..see no real reason to load the caps in that manner,them being F&T´s or not. They ARE after all rated for 500VDC..and that´s it and as the pulldown is in there already as is..it stays.
With the new rectifier tube in place i now saw 466VDC@30mA a pop. Done deal.
Now. True enough. Them two aluminium housed megauber resistors DO get hot. True that. They´re mounted to the righthand side shortside of the chassis and it DOES get hot..no argument,but...OTOH..no harm no foul-sorta.
It´s kind of almost amazing how the small details make for all the difference. Them screws in black instead...yep. Me happy. Now there´s nothing that sticks out in the same manner. Made for all the difference IMO.
In turn. Giving thought to letting the mA meter show bias. The amp came with that contraption remember..and there´s this 6 way switch too...
Anyways.
The rehearsal? What can i say? Flyin colours,that simple.
The amp sounds REALLY REALLY good. About liquid gold...amazing even. Only drawback is that it turns out that the old 6SJ7 turns microphonic as it gets really hot..so that needs to be replaced. Not the end of the world as they´re not all THAT expensive after all.
In turn i´m gonna replace them beutiful stock 6L6G flasks too. Now that i know that they work i see no reason to run them into the ground for the sake of argument..so gonna replace them with modern glass as i intend to use the amp a bit.
That said tho..REAL happy with it.
Next up,the cab. I´m gonna take them hinges off and hand them som TLC. A few of them have had their hingebolts replaced with regular machine screws n nuts..and that doesn´t exactly look all that kosher.
In turn..
Modern day n era amps sports speaker out at the rear. That can´t very well be had here without taking the router to the cab n....nah.. So gonna fab a bracket of the same material i used for the faceplate and bolt that to the wall of the cab approx where that sheetmetal box was when i got it. The one that held the extra 6SJ7...

So.
The sun´s got spots too it turns out. As the amp got really warm and placed on a cab...i got oscillation if i turned the dial up for the 6SJ7. Hm. Annoying to say the least.
First thing´s first tho...i replaced them old beutiful 6L6G flasks with more current offering to save the stockers for a rainy day. That done i ordered a pair of Shuguang 6L6G bottles...amazed by the fact that they are still produced.
Well. Fresh powertubes comin up shortly
Anyways.
The 6SJ7. Microphonic. This is rather common for pentodes of the sort n..what can i say? I traced it to the fact that when turned on the PT gave off a small electromechanical hum. Tighened it down and..way better. The oscillation was still there tho,indicating that the vibrations given off by the PT was transferred via the chassis into the solidly mounted octal socket for the tube.
K. So i first of all dug up an old Dynacord socket. Reason for this being that the solderprongs are ""weaker"" and hence them legs can flex more then with a regular type socket.
Second of all i drilled the mounting holes out to 6mm and inserted them rubber grommets. They also feature a metal tube within..hence you bolt the thing solidly to the chassis and the socket ""floats"" on the rubber grommets.
It indeed did for a WORLD of difference! Now i could basically bottom the dial out...and the amp remained still as a mouse. However..as i cracked the dials open for the 6n2p preamp tube i had me ANOTHER oscillation!
That was just due to interference. Tried moving the wiring for the socket around,and that indeed changed the scenario but wouldn´t alleviate it. Now..the 6n2p i configed different to a regular ECC-83...so i tied pin 9 together with the center of the socket (has one of them protruding metal inserts) and then then tied that to ground. Presto.
Silence.
The trimcap ontop was for trials,if needed. It has been omitted since.
While at it...ya know...both suspenders and a belt..i figured i´d take it the whole 9yrds...so...
Keeping with Geloso heritage i fabbed this shield out of low grade stainless and bolted that thing to the chassis. As you can see it basically says hell no to anything outside of the pot area. For real,and indeed...now we were getting somewhere.
It seems the setup likes signal vs the powertubes. Jogging the installed PPIMV you about need to bottom that dial out to get full performance from the unit,something that is rather rare with a PPIMV. No matter,now she sings. As in really sings.
As i fooled around with the amp it soon enough became evident that the voltage gain provided by the 6SJ7 simply was over the top so i opted to install a 220k trimpot inbound for the 6n2p as a voltage divider thereby being able to adjust the amp as i see fit.
As is she can really be dialed from squeeky clean to....well,swap for the other jack and we´re talking heavymetal mayhem.

So.
Ordered a pair of russian/chinese 6p3s.
..n talk about screwed. What i unwrapped was a pair of 6p3s alright...just with metalparts dangling around inside . Curtains.
Right now i´m undecided. Dunno what to do about this.
At the same time i got a fresh 6SJ7 and truth be told i was struck down to the point where i didn´t even bother to check that one..
Update.
I had my mind set on replacing the two old stock 6L6G tubes with fresh glass.
So. Ordered a pair from England and as they show up it turns out they´re broken . Chatted a bit with the seller and he agreed to send me a fresh pair. A gentleman in short.
That said i at the same time bough a fresh 6SJ7 from Germany.
An old Japanese made one. See..that old 6SJ7 in there had a tendency to turn microphonic...and that ""Ten"" tube there turned out to be exactly what the Dr ordered.
That said..
I had a really minimum annoyance in that as it dimed all the controls in 6SJ7 mode i got an ever so slight hum. Now..i like my amps to be dead silent in idle so..started trying to figure that out.
Then i recalled an old post on our local Swedish forum where it was mentioned that some of them older series 6x tubes has their heaters running in para with the cathode or WTF ever...
So.
The centertap for the heaters had already been taken out of commision right and had been replaced by a 500 Ohm trimpot,which wiper then headed for ground. A surefire way of setting up an adjustable artificial CT.
Then..that post i mention,so i started by elevating said CT to approx 50VDC positive...no dice...then hooked it to one of the cathode resistors for just shy of 2VDC positive...no dice.
Then. To hell with it..so hooked it to 44VDC negative (bias supply) and BINGO! Silent as a mouse. Got to dial that trimpot for an absolute minimum of fuzz out the speaker and..as the rest of the amp is basically built according to the text book we had ourselves an amp which in 3stage 6SJ7 mode in essence just produced an ever so slight hiss at wide open throttle-on all counts.
Happy?
Very. Now the amp is all it can be..and takes whatever you toss at it.

Editor’s note: This article is part of a series of blog posts by leaders in health and health care who participated in Spotlight Health from June 25-28, the opening segment of the Aspen Ideas Festival . This year’s theme was Smart Solutions to the World’s Toughest Challenges. Stayed tuned for more.
With much fanfare earlier this year, the Obama administration announced an aggressive goal to process half of all Medicare payments by the end of 2018 through alternative payment models as opposed to traditional fee-for-service (FFS). Primary care is one of the most urgent sectors needing such payment reform. As Bob Berenson succinctly put it, “Fee-for-service, the predominant physician payment scheme, has contributed to both the continuing decline in the primary care workforce and the capability to serve patients well.”
Unfortunately the alternative payment models for primary care currently offered or being proposed by Medicare involve additional payments on top of fee-for-service. Like an addict, we seem unable to go “cold turkey” and instead insist on just a little of our drug.
But this approach is bound to fail. If we truly want to move to a value-driven world and support a value-based payment model, we need to be willing to drop fee-for-service entirely. Current Fee-For-Service
Primary care fee-for-service only pays a doctor for a certain set of discrete activities—largely confined to doctor sick visits—which are tiered by means of an arcane coding system counting very discrete micro tasks, such as how many organ systems a doctor examines, or what questions a doctor asks a patient about the quality of their symptoms.
This encourages every health care issue or question to become a doctor visit (because that is paid for), and for the doctor to do most things instead of others on the team (because that is what is paid for). It leads to reactive care (since thinking of a patient not in front of you isn’t paid for), and leads to framing the job as taking care of one patient at a time, like a never-ending series of widgets on an assembly line.
Electronic health records, not surprisingly, are thus built to optimize this fee-for-service payment, particularly the coding level of each visit, and leads to lots of useless points and clicks and incredibly long notes that, in retrospect, are extremely difficult to comprehend. And practices spend a huge percent of their time and overhead dealing with all of this, which is really just a game, and does not lead to one iota of better patient care.
Fee-for-service is simply the wrong model to pay for primary care. It is toxic to good care and to physician and team culture, so we should simply stop using it, not try to supplement it. Primary care should be about continuous healing relationships, and discretely paying for services is antithetical to this. A Comprehensive Payment Model
For the past four years we at Iora Health have been building and operating over a dozen primary care practices across the United States that are purely based on a wholly different and simple comprehensive payment model. We start with a risk-adjusted fixed fee per patient for all of our services, and in some cases add additional payment for meeting experience, quality, or utilization targets, and/or some sort of shared savings off expected total health care costs.
What we do not do is take any sort of fee-for-service payment. Our billing for employers or union trusts are often a one-line monthly email with three numbers: the number of patients we are caring for times the rate we should be paid equals the size of the check to send us. No codes, explanation of benefits, or appeals.
Instead of perceiving their jobs as seeing one patient at a time—which can feel like an assembly line worker at times—our teams now see their job as having a defined population who are their responsibility, and their role is to improve their health, and keep them out of trouble (e.g. the hospital, emergency room, and unnecessary procedures).
Our teams can now be creative to meet our patients needs however they need to — whether by the doctor, nurse, social worker, or health coach; and whether it be in person, by email, text, video, group, home, or hospital visit. They even can spend small amounts of money on patients to address non-health care needs such as housing and transportation in order to help improve a patient’s overall health.
We have implemented this model successfully with different sorts of payers (we call them sponsors) with different patient populations in different parts of the country: Individuals
We have practices where individuals pay us a fixed fee to get primary care. For instance, we have a practice serving largely undocumented, uninsured Grameen America (a Nobel prize-winning microfinance organization) members in Jackson Heights, New York. Self-Insured Employers And Union Trusts
Based on this payment model, we contract with purchasers of care directly to build near-site practices for their employees and families. Because they are self-insured, the sponsor benefits from the decreased downstream care, e.g. reduced hospitalizations and unnecessary procedures (and improved productivity). For example, we operate practices for participants in the Culinary Health Fund , which insures hotel and casino workers in Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as employees and families of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Health Insurance Plans
We also are paid under this comprehensive care model to operate practices for members of progressive health insurers such as Medicare Advantage patients with Humana in Seattle, Washington and Phoenix, Arizona . Lessons Learned
What we have learned is that patients love the sort of relationship-based care we can provide; our physicians and teams love being able to do what they went into medicine to do — take care of patients and be creative in doing so, and not feel like code monkeys and assembly line workers. We are able to really do population management (focus on proactively managing chronic conditions) and improve the health of our patients, and we are able to help our patients dramatically reduce unnecessary downstream care.
Some other implementation lessons we have learned: Payment Change Is Necessary But Not Sufficient
Comprehensive payment alone doesn’t change anything, but it allows providers to then dramatically change the process model, implement fundamentally different information technology (IT) systems, and build a very different culture — this is what improves care. Simply Changing The Way We Pay Isn’t Enough
We also need to increase the share of health care spending going into primary care. The way to get the right comprehensive payment isn’t to add up what we currently do in FFS. We currently spend only 5 percent or so of total health care on primary care, and we have found the right level is approximately double this (roughly 10 percent of total health care spending) in order to optimize a patient’s health and total health care spending. It Is Critical To Risk Adjust The Primary Care Payment
So you get paid more not for doing more, but for caring for sicker patients. This is important to prevent any disincentives to take care of sicker patients. There are a number of ways we have found to do this, for instance by using available risk adjusters such as HCC (Hierarchical Condition Categories) or MARA (Milliman Advanced Risk Adjuster) scores, or making the primary care payment 10 percent of the prior year’s total health care spending. All of these are better than not doing any adjustment, but none are perfect, and more work needs to be done in this area. You Need To Not Only Change How The Practice Is Paid, But Also Change How You Pay Your Providers And Others
Perhaps it is obvious, but having the practice get paid in a comprehensive model but continuing to pay your doctors by RVU s (relative value units or “productivity”) is not a good idea. In general we have found simply paying our doctors (and teams) a simple fair salary is the easiest and best model. Our strategy is to hire people who are intrinsically motivated and want to work hard and do the right thing. We believe if we have to pay people a bonus to do the right thing, it’s not clear why we are paying them a salary in the first place. It Is Hard To Operate A Practice With Both A Comprehensive Payment For Some Patients And Fee-For-Service For Others At The Same Time
As long as you do any FFS, you still need the old coding and administrative systems, and it is very different to truly change the processes, technology, and culture. The sort of care one delivers to optimize comprehensive payment isn’t a little different than the sort of care to optimize FFS — it’s completely different and sometimes diametrically opposed.
For instance under FFS it is better economically to have a patient come in once a month whether they need it or not to get their blood pressure checked, while with a comprehensive payment model we have our patients regularly check their blood pressures at home and send them to us, and adjust their regimens by email or text messages, and only come in if these are not working.
Despite the general and growing agreement that the current fee-for-service payment model is toxic to primary care, we continue to find lots of resistance to change among both physicians and insurers. Even when we get paid a comprehensive fee, many of our sponsors continue to ask that we submit dummy claims (claims with the usual information but for which we don’t get paid) anyway. Like an addict they cling to their old behaviors almost instinctively. When we ask why they need our claims they respond “because everyone else sends them to us, and we can compare you to them.”
But we shouldn’t compare practices based on how many visits they do, but rather on the results they produce. We are happy to be compared on our patient experience, clinical outcomes, and impact on downstream costs, but how we achieve this should be up to us, not the payer. Simply measuring visits or other FFS-like processes even if not tied to payment makes you create the same sort of discrete tracking systems that create the wrong culture and processes.
If Medicare and others really want to innovate and create new value-based payment models, we believe they should have the courage to go “cold turkey,” let go completely of fee-for-service, and allow the same comprehensive payment models we at Iora Health have been implementing for many years."

Donald Trump, the inspiration of internet memes such as Paint with Donald Trump and a 3D printed butt-plug found himself in hot water with T-Mobile US CEO John Legere.

Trump, never one for turning down a spat on the social network came back with:

And then Legere went to town.

With Trump’s 4.88 and Legere’s 1.81 million Twitter followers, it was probably one of the most public flame wars we’ve seen in quite a while.

Trump’s seemingly impenetrable public persona seems to come out relatively unscathed from the encounter, seeing a huge bump in his Twitter reach in the last 24 hours, according to Simply Measured. Legere on the other hand brought a whole world of trolling pain to his door.

Why Negative Ads Against Donald Trump Haven't Worked So Far $1 Million in Attack Ads Don't Seem to Hurt Trump in Iowa Published on Learn more
If establishment Republicans think that running negative TV advertisements will quell the wave of support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Midwest voters say they should think again.
While waiting for Mr. Trump to arrive for a rally in Davenport, Iowa, on Saturday, voters who say they are still weighing their options said they would either not be swayed or be more likely to support the real estate mogul if they were to see negative ads on their televisions bashing the GOP front-runner.
""If anything, I think it'll stir up Trump's base more and maybe engage them more,"" Curt Anderson, a 20 year-old from Orion, Illinois, said.
Brenda Wolf, 70, from Bettendorf, Iowa, who has still not decided who to vote for, said negative ads would not change her mind. ""That has nothing to do with us,"" she said. As she pointed to the Trump podium in front of her, she added, ""This has everything to do with us.""
In recent weeks, as Mr. Trump continues to lead in the polls and the Republican establishment grows more anxious about his potential to ultimately become the party's nominee, negative ads targeting the billionaire have begun cropping up.
John Kasich's super-PAC, New Day for America, has already invested $2.5 million in hostile ads on television, radio, online and through direct mail.
Earlier this year, a Club for Growth super-PAC spent $1 million in Iowa on ads attacking Mr. Trump. Those efforts do not seem to be piercing Mr. Trump's Teflon coating, as he continues to hold a commanding lead in national and early state polling.
In November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Liz Mair, the former online communications director for the RNC, and other establishment figures in the party worried about Mr. Trump's rise are forming a ""self-styled guerrilla campaign"" called Trump Card LLC. The group will be backed by anonymous donors with a goal to take down the front-runner.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump stormed Iowa with back-to-back rallies. The first, in Spencer, attracted an audience of 1,500. The second, in Davenport, had an audience of 2,500, according to the Trump campaign. For those in the audience still shopping around, seeing a negative ad against Mr. Trump from an establishment figure would almost certainly backfire. Learn more
""They got us into this mess, so why listen to them?"" said Kim, a 49-year-old from Highland, Illinois.
""They're the reason we're in the state we're in. It's career politicians that don't have my interests in mind,"" Kim's husband, Jeff, 49, said. ""The more our people run negative ads against other people in our party, the more it makes me mad.""
Mr. Trump routinely presents himself to voters as an anti-establishment, outsider candidate, an image that supporters cite as being among their top reasons for backing him. That's one reason that negative advertisements against Mr. Trump may prove ineffective, according to Bloomberg Politics'advertising analyst Ken Goldstein.
""If you believe that people are still shopping around and if you believe that all of these polls are simply measuring people who are not actually going to show up on a cold February night, then byadvertising all you're doing is mobilizing more people who wouldn't vote anyway and are probably not going to vote for an establishment candidate regardless,"" Mr. Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said.
Many voters in Davenport seemed to concur.
""I would probably want to vote for him more,"" Mary, 45, from Wheatland, Iowa, said when asked about the effect of anti- Trump ads.
Mr. Goldstein does, however, think that negative advertising could hurt Mr. Trump in Iowa if it targets one specific group: evangelicals, who make up 60% of Iowa caucus goers. Turning them against Mr. Trump by using targeted mailings might prove effective, Mr. Goldstein said, if the candidate's past positions on abortion rights and advocacy for a single-payer healthcare system were targeted.
""Why was advertising so devastating to Mitt Romney? Because at the end of the day Mitt Romney's main message was 'I'm a job creator' while the Obama message was 'No, you're a job destroyer,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""If Trump's big message is 'I'm aggressive, I'm tough, I'm conservative' then saying things that don't knock at his strengths may not matter.""
Voters who said they would not be swayed by ads that focus on Mr. Trump's rhetoric on the trail would be more likely to look into whether the charges were true, Goldstein argues. Those in attendance at Trump's rallies over the weekend seemed to prove Goldstein's point.
""I think if I fact-checked it myself and looked into whatever negative aspect they are pointing out I would take that a lot more seriously,"" Ryan, 30, from Silvis, Illinois, said.

"AlaskaVaper said: ↑ Doesn't that 10 - 100 adjustment sound and read just like the SXK ""nickel purity"" setting? Click to expand... Yes exactly, they've used the same scale. But it's not the SXK chip though, just they've used the same scale.
AlaskaVaper said: ↑ Bloke- I have a question for you. On a TC mod that allows adjustment of the res of the addy, how would that affect the TCR settings. I believe the Evic mini allows some adjustment of the res so I wondered just how that relates in the overall picture of TC. Thanks. Click to expand... The short answer is that, at least for 99.9% of people, it wouldn't. Rather, it would affect the accuracy and therefore possibly the target temperature.
On mods without adjustable resistance, you have two resistance values: the real coil resistance, and the resistance read by the mod; the latter includes a certain amount of Static Resistance (SR) in the atomizer. The amount of SR is ideally in the milli-ohm range, like 0.005Ω, where it will account for no noticeable inaccuracy. Once it gets up to 0.01Ω it can cause an inaccuracy around 3°C for a coil with a base resistance of 0.50Ω (ie Titanium), but up to 20°C for a coil with 0.12Ω (ie Ni200.) If it gets to 0.1Ω, the TC is hundreds of degrees out for low-res Ni200, and about 40°C (100°F) out for a 0.50Ω coil eg of Titanium.
The normal way to account for this is to adjust the temperature. We pretty much do that automatically, without thinking about it. ""This vape is a bit anaemic, I'll put the temp up a few degrees"" / ""Damn, dry hit, I've got this one set a bit too high."" In a perfect world, we'd never have to do this - a 230°C / 450°F vape would always be a 230/450 vape across every build and every atomizer, it would always vape the same. But varying amounts of SR mean we often adjust the temperature slightly for different situations.
Now, a couple of months ago at the start of my Beyond Ni200 thread we were discussing doing exactly what you seem to be implying - in mods with TCR adjustment, changing the TCR rather than the temperature. A guy, whose name I can't remember but he hasn't posted in months so I'm not going to look it up , came up with a formula by which we could work out how much to change the TCR to account for a known amount of SR.
The idea was that if we knew there was, let's say, 0.03Ω SR - a large amount - we would set the TCR to a value that would give an accurate vape at the target temperature we wanted. Instead of 0.0035 for Titanium (35 on eg the Apollo and SXK scale), we'd maybe sent 0.0033, 33.
We discussed that idea because at the time, adjusting the resistance itself was impossible.
In practice, no-one bothers. The amount of SR is usually unknown, and running a formula for every build would be annoying. SR can be measured, but it can also vary even vape by vape - did you tighten the atomizer absolutely as tight this time as last time? What about those atomizers where the annoying air flow control ring always gets in the way of a really tight screw down? Etc.
Besides, changing the TCR is usually more work and effort than changing the temperature. On the Smok for example, temperature is changed by simple up/down presses, where TCR requires maybe 10 different button presses to access in the menu. And then if you swap to a different atomizer, you've got to calculate and adjust for it again.
And remember that you did so: no mod with TCR adjustment shows it on screen outside of a menu. The DNA 200 doesn't even show it on-mod, only via the PC, and even with its customisable screens it doesn't offer a field that shows the number of the active Profile; a strange omission.
It's much easier keeping the TCR at the standard value appropriate for the coil material, and adjusting temperature to suit the given atomizer/build. (One exception: we know in the Smok that it always under-heats the coil. We could work out a single TCR value that counteracts that, eg setting 0.0037 or 0.004 for Titanium. But actually that's not even an exception; what'd we be doing is replacing one static TCR with another, to counteract the fault (or deliberate meddling) inside the mod to ensure we get accurate temp settings. I plan to do that measuring soon. )
OK that was long, and I still haven't covered adjustable res! OK, so in the Smok we have adjustable res. What does that mean? It means that in certain circumstances we can change the atomizer resistance the mod uses. There's two reasons we might do that:
In this particular attachment of the atty, we attached it when it wasn't perfectly cold, so the reading is too high. We happen to know the real value, so let's correct it down to save waiting and unscrewing/rescrewing the atomizer. The Smok has no refinement, so it won't correct automatically. In general, we know the amount of SR in a given atomizer/build, so let's remove it from the resistance reading to give the most accurate TC 1 is by far the most common case - there's a good chance we might know the resistance reading of a given atomizer, from repeated attachments. For example I might do Set Resistance on my Yihi SX Mini M and see the three digit figure. Then I might vape a bit on this atomizer, and later decide to transfer it to the Smok instead. I transfer it across, either forget to wait or choose not to wait for it to cool down, and then use Adjustable Initial Ohms to set it to the figure I know the SXM read - the three digit value if I can remember it, or at least the two digit shown on the SXM screen, if the Smok is that far out.
2 would be great for ultimate TC accuracy, if we can know what the SR of an atomizer is. I have a cheap ($50 from eBay) Chinese four-wire 'micro' ohm reader (actually more like hundred-milli-ohm; 4 digits of accuracy) and I have recently started measuring atomizer components. This is giving me an idea of the SR in my atomizers.
Another way is to simply measure the resistance of the coil before it goes on the atomizer - though I've found getting a stable reading on a coil a bit harder. I have built a test rig that I can attach coils to securely, and then measure them more accurately directly on my ohm reader. But even that isn't perfect - when I attach the coil I'm going to cut off some of the wire to get it in the posts. I can try measuring it in-situ, in the atomizer, but that can also be tricky; it sometimes works measuring screw-to-screw.
Either way, if we can work out an SR figure, we can use Adjustable Initial Ohms to set the mod to use that figure. Then, we can hope to set the real temperature we want on the mod, and not be adding or removing 10°C here and there. (Again, clouded on the Smok by the fact that you always have to add at least 20°C - but that could be solved once we come up with new, pre-adjusted TCR figures.)
In summary: Your original question was: how does adjustable ohms affect TCR. It doesn't, because we're not changing the TCR for every atomizer and its varying SR, because that's far too cumbersome. But Adjustable Ohms could give us more accurate TC, in theory reducing our need to keep adjusting temperature for each atomizer and build. It could theoretically lead to a point where 230°C is the same temperature on every atomizer and build.
But only in theory, because most people aren't going to have the high resolution ohm reader to pre-measure their coil or atomizer components, and frankly even for those of us who do, it's not that practical to do regularly.
More importantly, I've found it's just not that necessary - firstly I am already fairly satisfied that most of my atomizers have fairly minimal SR, and secondly it's much quicker just to add or subtract 5-20°C when I feel I need it, than it is to do all that measuring.
If I was using more unreliable atomizers, like I've heard the Subtank Mini is, I might feel a bit differently. And maybe I should get out my venerable STM and test its RDA deck sometime, to see what SR it gives.
I did think maybe in future I could pre-measure all or most of my atomizers, and write down their known SR figures. I might still try that. But I already know that most of them are low enough - under 0.01Ω - that it's not going to be that important with Titanium and NiFe wire. With Ni200 and its ultra low resistance it'd be much more important, but who uses that any more?"

The term social refers to a characteristic of living organisms as applied to populations of humans and other animals. It always refers to the interaction of organisms with other organisms and to their collective co-existence, irrespective of whether they are aware of it or not, and irrespective of whether the interaction is voluntary or involuntary. and then there's no definite definition of commercial, the first being: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising; I just want the 2004 version of FB back

Dark social describes any web traffic that’s not accredited to a known source, such as a social network or a Google search.
You know the feeling.
@SimplyMeasured "2"
Not important because traffic volume has many other factors than referrals. And even if your metric mattered it still doesn't really matter. Google owns a lot more real estate than Facebook. You have to start looking at asset base.
@simplymeasured 2
Social Media ROI is a problem because it’s not easy to solve. And it’s not easy to solve because we’re thinking about it wrong.
Prioritizing analytics → You know what works and what doesn’t → You’re able to plan more efficiently → You work smarter, not quicker → You make decisions with confidence.

The rest of my story:: When I would leave the track after a long hot run, the idle oil pressure back in the paddock was higher with the xW-40 oils (45 PSI) than with the xW-50 oils (35 PSI). This tells me that the 'thinner' oil was operating at a higher kinemetric viscocity than the 'thicker' oils. The drop of 15 dF (from 280dF to 265dF) was more than enough to make up for the 'thinness' of the oil. So, if you have both an oil temp guage and an oil pressure guage, you can simply measure the results. {Note: this experiment was conducted with 3 different xW-50 oils and 3 different xW-40 oils and 1 xW-30 oil. The difference between xW-50 oils was unmeasurable, the difference between the xW-40 oils was unmeasureable, and the xW-30 oil resulted in oil consumption issues at the track, so I discontinued this portion of the test. All oils were from M1, RL, and AMSoil}

Thanks for the response Simply Measured, I've used them on Facebook, but there are so many different opinions on if this would be a correct platform for its use. At one time It was known to keep hashtags to Twitter and Instagram and that it serves no function on FB. But, then why would Facebook have a section dedicated to trending topics that use hashtags? Forbes current #MyTopCollege campaign requires participants to use hashtags on all social media posts in order to be counted, so currently I'm using them for that kind of posts.

Qu'est-ce qu'un influenceur? Comment arrive-t-on à rejoindre les influenceurs? Comment profiter de leur notoriété et rejoindre leur communauté? Un article fort intéressant présenté par Simply Measured.
"Well, I decided to turn the DARC into something a lot more fun to drive. I happen to have a ton of Durango stuff lying around, so this was super easy to throw together, and gets you something very unique.
Here's how it's made:
First, convert your DEX410 to a DARC. You don't have to have a DARC conversion, but I happen to have one. I used it because it's a longer wheelbase than the standard issue DEX410 (the regular 410 will work just fine). You should be able to find PLENTY of used, cheap 410's kicking around the internet.
Next, remove the arms, hubs, knuckles, links, outboard drive shafts and shock towers. Say goodbye to the buggy wheels and tires.
Now grab a DESC410. There's also plenty of cheap used DESC410's for sale all over the place. Harvest the same parts that you removed from above (arms, hubs, knuckles, links, outboard drive shafts and shock towers). Throw out the plastic shock towers and get some nice DESC410 carbon towers.
Bolt it all up to the DEX410 chassis. Its all 100% direct fit and completely compatible with no modifications whatsoever, right down to the hingepins. Toss out the short course tires. You won't need them.
Purchase Team Durango stadium truck wheels and some suitable tires for your local track. Mount 'em up. You may have to clearance the front arms at the outer ends where they extend into the rims to prevent rubbing when steering. Very little material to remove. 2 minutes with a dremel.
You'll need to replace the front outer steering tie rod ends with hooked ends to clearance the wheels. I chose the RC4wd ends as they were readily available to me. They come in long and short versions:
http://store.rc4wd.com/M3-Offset-Sho...0x_p_1741.html
http://store.rc4wd.com/M3-Offset-Lon...0x_p_1740.html
The stadium truck wheels are larger than your old buggy wheels by quite a bit. You'll need to change your gear ratio by quite a bit to get around the track properly. I chose the associated 93 tooth spur gear for my truck, but you'll have to get the center machined out to fit the Durango shaft size if you want to use it. This works very well with hot motors like 5.5's or 5700kv's. If you run a lower KV motor you can get away with the stock 87 tooth durango gear and a nice small pinion.
4 pole motors work best on this conversion because the 410 is already a heavy kit to begin with, and now it weighs even more.
Start by following typical online setups for DESC410's for shock pistons and oils. Tune from there. I went with the lightest springs (yellow) from the White series of hard Durango springs:
http://www.team-durango.com/blog/wp-...h-big-bore.jpg
Now you'll need a body. I grabbed a Losi mid motor stadium truck body (it was conveniently at the hobby shop). You'll need a mid motor body so that the shock tower bulges in the body are in the correct location.
You'll have to make your own body mounts for this project. Mine are very straight forward: Simple angle aluminum purchased at Home Depot, cut to size and bolted onto the shock towers through existing holes. Then simply measure, cut and mount vertical body posts to your angled mounts, line up the body and mount it up.
This thing really rips around the track. On super small tight tracks, I find its a few tenths slower than my 410 buggy. Put it on a medium to large track and it really starts to shine. The rougher it gets, the better it handles compared to the buggy.
Pictures to follow shortly"

7 Easy Steps to Test Your Well Water Flow Rate Hello Peter,Thank you for contacting us through our website. You wrote: “been at this location 10 years , go through faucets , dishwashers , drains , and one hot water heater every year . Harr well drilling replaced existing treatment system 2 years ago . still having problems” Ok sir, first of all, you wrote that your flow rate is 1.6 gpm. That’s really low, where did you get that number from? You could barely run a shower with a flow rate like that. If you need to run a test on your flow rate, here are instructions on how to determine flow rate for wells with pressure tanks: It is easy! All you need is a 1 or 5 gallon bucket and a watch or clock! It takes just a few minutes. Just follow these steps:1. Open any hose bib or faucet until well pump turns on.2. Close hose bib or faucet and let pump fill up pressure tank until well turns off.3. Using a 1 or 5 gal. bucket, open faucet, collect and measure all water discharged until pump turns on. NOTE: You do not have to fill the buckets as fast as you can; simply measure the water. 4. When pump turns on, immediately close faucet and start timing pump cycle in seconds until well shuts off. 5. Divide the number of gallons collected in Step 3 by the number of seconds in Step 4.6. Multiply the answer from Step 5 by 60.7. The answer in Step 6 is the average pumping capacity of the pump in gallons per minute (GPM). Second of all, do you happen to have a well water report that we could refer to? Ideally, we would need to have the water analysis on hand in order to know what to recommend to you. If you’re interested, here is a link to a test kit that we offer, that you can use to cover the basic mineral content of your water: http://www.cleanwaterstore.com/L1004720.html Basically, it’s a two-part test kit. It includes testing at home, on-site, that you would perform yourself for iron, pH, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, etc… and it also includes two sample bottles in a mailer that goes back to use for testing at our lab. The lab test is quite accurate and gives results for hardness, manganese, iron, TDS, and pH. Between the home testing and lab results, we should have everything we need to make a great recommendation for you on how to remove that iron and prevent odor and staining problems.

Environmental advocates want to see solar energy as a part of the Tar Heel State's response to the EPA's Clean Power Plan. (pedrojperez/morguefile) January 5, 2016 WILMINGTON, N.C. - Today the final public hearing takes place in North Carolina on the topic of the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. The hearings are organized by Gov. McCrory's administration. Members of the community are expected in Wilmington to ask the state to include renewable energy sources in its plan to reduce carbon emissions as mandated by the federal agency. Dustin Chicurel-Bayard, communications director for the Sierra Club of North Carolina, says despite the recent global agreement in Paris on improving the environment, there's little evidence of state support for real change. "What we're seeing is a drastic shift," says Chicurel-Bayard. "Unfortunately the current administration is putting up more roadblocks, rather than leading us forward down this path that we've been going on." The Clean Power Plan allows for states to establish the best pathway to reduce carbon pollution. Chicurel-Bayard and others argue the best way to do that is to further build on solar and wind energy efforts. The state says the Clean Air Act does not authorize the EPA to issue rules that go beyond simply measuring pollution from power plants. The state's current proposed plan is focused on carbon emissions from coal plants. Chicurel-Bayard says it neglects to examine all three methods of reducing pollution, including the greater use of gas or renewables. "What we would like to see is more clean energy built on our foundation, more pollution controls to protect our communities and that's what people are going to be advocating for and unfortunately, that's not what the governor's plan is calling for," he says. The Clean Power Plan requires the state to include all three aspects of improving air quality. The public can continue to submit comments through Jan. 15 through the Department of Environmental Quality's website. Stephanie Carson/Mary Kuhlman,

Load More The New Year kicked off with an ugly sell-off on Monday, and many investors asked Jim Cramer what to do with FANG — which stands for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) — and the once popular favorite Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) .
What should they do if they already own these stocks, or want to own them?
Cramer said that FANG should be avoided right now. These stocks are up so much that he now expects profit-taking. Actually, it would be insane if that didn't happen at this point.
""I know about the process of money management. Money managers are under tremendous pressure to outperform the S&P 500 (INDEX: .SPX) . They also want to show that they are 'with it' and have a 'brain',"" the "" Mad Money "" host said.
The best way to demonstrate that a money manager is ""with it"" is to buy the stocks that make up FANG going into the year end, since they were up huge for 2015.
Once the money manager owns these stocks, they will try to keep the stocks higher in the last few weeks of the year, typically through concentrated buying.
Cramer regarded both of these techniques as artificial buying — and it will disappear the moment the New Year begins.
This could explain why all members of FANG were hit heavily in Monday's trading session.

Cramer: The market is totally irrational!
Cramer: Horrifying stocks to avoid in a sell-off
Cramer: Stocks that get stronger in a decline
From a valuation perspective, Cramer found that both Amazon and Netflix are plays that do not trade based on standard measurements of valuation. These stocks trade off of growth in retail sales and sign up, and cannot be simply measured. That means they have no inherent valuation that makes them buyable right now.
View gallery Adam Jeffery | CNBC. Jim Cramer provides advice on the best way for investors to play FANG and Apple … ""Sure, you can go buy them if you can't help yourself. But if you want to minimize the risk of paying too much, why not wait until the full magnitude of that artificial buying wears off?"" Cramer said.
Alphabet trades at a far more reasonable valuation compared to the rest of the group. However the stock traded up to almost $800 from $530 in 2015, so Cramer wants investors to wait for pullback and then buy this stock first in the group.
As for Apple, the world has decided that without growth in cellphones the stock is finished. But there is another market that is big enough to matter down the road — autos.
Cramer recommended for Apple to spend $9 billion to buy the brains behind the connected car, Harman. At its current valuation, Cramer only wants those investors that do not own Apple to buy it. But if you already own it, he wants you to wait.
""You now have your rationale. Don't bet against the percentages. They can be wrong, but not as often as they can be right,"" Cramer said.

"Re: Why Doesn't This Work? It is not exactly clear what you are hoping to have in the finished result. Does the floor timber sit on top of the keel leaving a vertical gap on either side? If that's the case, I'd do it the way lupussonic described above. Use the keel top as the datum. There will be a point where a line from the top of the keel intersects the first plank. Mark that point on each side of the timber. Then simply measure up to the first ""joggle"" and transfer that measurement to the timber (it will be a semicircular mark from the first intersection point. Use the bevel gauge to get the angle and that will tell you where the first ""joggle goes. After that it is really just a matter of taking distance and angle measurements from that point out on each side.
Since you have not described how you are doing this, it is pretty hard to say what you might be doing wrong, but from the look of things it may be that you measured the face of each plank, and then transferred that laterally to the timber to locate the next ""joggle"". It has to be transferred on an angle, otherwise it will put the joggle too far out (which is what it looks like happened). Think of this like dead reckoning navigation. You start at the point where a horizontal line that touches the keel top intersects the plank. And then from that point you dead reckon your way to each of the subsequent ""waypoints""...From each point where the direction of the cut line changes, there is both a distance to the next point where it changes, and an angle, so you would scribe a circle (or a portion of a circle) with the correct distance, and then get the angle between the current cut line and the next cut line with a bevel gauge. Where that angled line intersects the circle is the location of the next point.

"Art is not measured purely by skill. Nor is it measured purely by subjectiveness.
You could have someone today imitate a painting style of what you would consider great, like Renaissance for example, but you could still see through it as just a vapid imitation.
The value of art is measured by a mixture of skill, meaning and soul. Modern art is not inherently trash, but it is easy to spot modern art that is vapid, and a condition of people brought up thinking ""anything is art. Art is subjective""
Subjectiveness simply measures whether you like it or not, not the measure of value. It's a separate thing"

"Byrne: Pats' chances rate with best Kerry J. Byrne   Credit: AP Bill Belichick comments Tweet Passer rating differential is the most reliable indicator of championship potential in all of North American sports. It’s the mother of all stats.
And the picture she paints for the Patriots is a hazy, confusing splotch of pigskin impressionism. With a full complement of weapons early in the season, the Pats were one of the NFL’s dominant statistical powers. The trend since then has been sharply downward, a spiral that began not with the 2-4 record since Thanksgiving but as early as Week 6.
The Patriots reached their statistical peak following their 30-6 rout of Dallas in Week 5. They emerged from that game plus-37.8 in PRD, yet they enter the playoffs a mere plus-14.9, their lowest mark of the entire campaign. Put another way, they enter the postseason as statistically suspect as they’ve looked all year.
But here’s the good news for Patriots fans: The team still is ranked No. 6 in the NFL in PRD. And that offers plenty of statistical confidence.
Passer rating differential simply measures the disparity between offensive passer rating and defensive passer rating (or the efficiency of all opposing quarterbacks against a team’s defense).
The importance of this indicator throughout NFL history cannot be understated, as 27-of-75 league champs (36 percent) since 1940 finished No. 1 in PRD, 45 (60 percent) ranked in the top three and 71 (94.7 percent) were in the top 10.
Week in and week out, year after year, decade after decade, the teams that dominate the battle of passing efficiency dominate on the scoreboard and in the standings. The 2015 season was no exception: The teams that produced the top 103 performances in PRD were an incredible 100-3.
The Patriots were 9-1 when they won the battle of passing efficiency. Their 2-4 stumble at the finish line coincided with — indeed was caused by — an inability to consistently win the battle of pass efficiency. But hope is not lost.
The AFC playoff field is, statistically speaking, among the weakest in history, with three flawed contenders (Broncos, Steelers, Texans) and two that look statistically stout but have poor postseason histories and huge question marks at quarterback (Bengals, Chiefs). None possesses the historic statistical profile of an NFL champion.
Here’s a look at the PRD profile of each AFC contender, plus a quick look at the field of NFC contenders, with a special focus on how each team has trended in the mother of all stats.
Cincinnati: The Bengals were the most consistent statistical force in the AFC. They started strong with a plus-30.2 PRD in their dominant Week 1 win against Oakland and rarely wavered. They enter the playoffs plus-25.2, best in the AFC. But Cincy has huge questions at QB: Injured starter Andy Dalton is 0-4 in his postseason career with a dismal 57.8 passer rating. Backup A.J. McCarron has started just three NFL games.
Kansas City: The Chiefs are the hottest team in the AFC, both on the scoreboard. They’ve won 10 straight and have trended upward in PRD every week of the streak. Their plus-19.4 PRD is No. 2 in the AFC. The Chiefs pair the second-best pass defense in football (76.0 defensive passer rating) with hugely efficient QB Alex Smith. But Smith has limited playoff experience: He’s 1-2 in 10 NFL seasons.
Denver: The Broncos are a statistical anomaly, going 12-4 with the AFC’s No. 1 seed despite habitually poor QB play and a PRD of minus-2.5. Only two teams in NFL history were upside-down in PRD and won a championship: the 1957 Lions and the 2007 Giants, who upset the unbeaten Patriots.
Denver statistically peaked in Week 2 (plus-29.2 PRD) while Peyton Manning threw 17 interceptions in just 10 games. And his playoff record is spottier than a Dalmatian with measles. Manning’s normally high-powered teams have averaged a dismal 15.2 points in his 13 career playoff losses. Don’t count on him to deliver this year, either.
Pittsburgh: The Steelers were consistently mediocre in 2015 and enter the postseason plus-0.30 in PRD, 16th in the NFL. Only one team in history won a championship with a PRD ranking worse than 12th: the 2007 Giants (24th).
Ben Roethlisberger put up big numbers but threw 16 picks in just 12 games, and he’s paired with a mediocre pass defense. It’s a bad combo. Pittsburgh’s six Super Bowl champs all were dominant in PRD. This team is not.
Houston: The Texans enter the playoffs plus-2.5 in PRD, their best mark of the season. Houston pairs a slightly above-average pass defense with a below-average passing game led by unproven Brian Hoyer (26 career starts). That combination spells an early playoff exit.
The NFC field: The Seahawks surged through the second half of the season behind an increasingly tough defense and the league’s most efficient QB in Russell Wilson (110.1 passer rating). They topped the NFL in PRD for just the second time in franchise history. The first was in 2013 when, not coincidentally, they won the Super Bowl.
The 15-1 Panthers finished No. 2 in PRD, while the statistically powerful Cardinals topped the PRD leaderboard much of the season before finishing fourth.
Bottom line for the Pats: Despite the long period of statistical struggles and with a slew of injured players returning for the playoffs, they are no worse than a 50-50 proposition to win the AFC and return to the Super Bowl for a seventh time in the Tom Brady era.
But don’t count on the Patriots to win it all. NFC powers Seattle, Carolina and Arizona would be — and should be — favored to beat the Patriots in Super Bowl 50.

Just because we’ve had record high temperatures in the past several years and general worrisome warming trend doesn’t mean that winters are going to get any easier in the Northeast. Now that cold weather is upon us, get your home buttoned up and ready for it with our expert hands-on game plan , which will not only make your home more comfortable and energy efficient, but save you some money while you’re at it. From big changes that will knock hundreds of dollars off your energy bill to smaller ones that need just a bit of elbow grease and a few materials from your local hardware store, we’ll show you what you need to get the job done! So no matter if you rent or own your house, check out these 7 handy tips that we promise will make a real difference in keeping you warm and your energy bill manageable this winter. TIP 1: Get an Energy Audit
Before we get into the nitty-gritty, we should mention that the best way to get your home operating at its maximum efficiency is to hire a professional BPI certified energy rater to evaluate your spaces. This person will conduct what’s called an “energy audit” and he or she will test your home for energy losses and safety issues, and generate a detailed report highlighting what your home’s issues are. With a report in hand you can easily target and prioritize exactly what you need to do , and what you can afford to do.
If you can’t afford an energy audit, you can start to identify and remedy some problem areas on your own with the help of an infrared thermometer, like the Ryobi Non-Contact Infrared Thermometer . This handy gun allows you to safely measure surface temperatures and pinpoint spots where your home is experiencing air leaks or missing insulation. As energy efficiency expert David Johnson says, “Air leaks account for 25-30% of an average energy bill, and this is one of the most profound steps that you can make for the betterment of your home’s comfort and reducing the amount of your monthly bill.”
Our tips ahead will address common problem areas seen in all types of homes, and they will offer solutions to problems that can be easily fixed, often without calling on help from a professional. TIP 2: Seal Your Walls
The mantra in green construction is: “seal it tight, ventilate right”. The sealing part is about getting a handle on all the places where air penetrates through the wall and causes drafts and fluctuations to the temperature inside your home. A simple tube of high quality caulk and a plan to tackle all those problem areas can go a long way if you know where to look (hint: grab your infrared thermometer ).
What keeps the outside air out of your home is typically the interior walls (or drywall), but you’ll find many holes that have been cut out of these walls to install your plugs and switches. If you have ever removed the face-plates of these plugs and switches during cold weather, you’ll have probably noticed some cold air pouring out. Reduce this leakage by using caulk to seal around the the area where the electric box meets the drywall. If you’re comfortable working around electricity, head to the breaker, turn it off, then test the outlets to make sure they are really off. Once off, you can then pull them out of the box and begin to seal up all the little holes in the back of the box, including where the wires come through. TIP 3: Seal Your Home’s Can Lights
Other notorious culprits that contribute to air leaks are recessed lights found in the ceiling. Many old can lights are actually vented on purpose to keep from being overheated by the lightbulb (they are called non-IC or non-insulation contact rated cans). Because warm air rises, an unsealed can light below a roof is a big problem. It’s a good idea is to remove the existing ring of this can and seal the can’s perimeter with caulk. The inside of the can should be sealed with either caulk or aluminum tape to keep your home’s warm air from escaping into the attic.
It’s very important that you not put an incandescent bulb in the can. Instead, opt for something like a Cree LED recessed light — this light is dimmable, super-efficient and does not build up heat. Moreover, if you have a non-IC rated can, it’s a really good idea to put a note inside to not use incandescent lights in the future. An overheated fixture has the potential to cause serious problems. If you can’t give up your incandescent, another approach is to go into the attic, install and seal a box made from drywall around the light, and then insulate from above. This has the added benefit of improving you r-value , or insulating effectiveness. TIP 4: Look For Insulation Gaps
Anywhere you have something that penetrates the wall, there is bound to be an air leak. Check out the outside faucets, air vents and plumbing for large gaps where air can escape. Seal the penetrations with expanding foam so that every nook and cranny is filled. Be careful to never seal next to a gas flue or you will have a fire hazard on your hands.
Once that is done, if you are ready to get dirty, check out where the foundation meets the house and crawlspace and fill those little forgotten cracks — note areas where you see even the slightest bit of daylight passing through. There is even an expanding foam for the big holes and a fire block version for holes between floors or for sealing electrical boxes. We also recommend practicing on a scrap surface to see how the foam works. Remember to wear gloves when using the foam — this stuff is really sticky before it sets!
While expanding foam is ideal when dealing with air leaks, spray-and-go won’t always work with those extra big gaps. In spots that need an extra bit of air-stopping artillery, we recommend rolling out some insulation. But before grab for that pink stuff on the shelf — a.k.a. fiberglass insulation — we recommend that you consider using Ultratouch denim insulation instead. Unlike its counterpart, Ultratouch is made from high-quality natural fibers (80% of which are post-consumer recycled) that provide for extremely effective sound absorption and good thermal performance. You also won’t have to worry about getting the “fiberglass itch” with the denim insulation; it is easy to handle and work with — but we still recommend using a mask . The perforated batts make off-size cavity installation easy. Simply measure, tear, carefully fit and cover with an air tight barrier and you are good to go. TIP 5: Check and Tune-up Your Heating System
Before the start of the cold season, it’s not a bad idea to tune up your furnace. 30% of an average home’s energy costs are related to heating, and this number can spike further if you have inefficiencies with your furnace or boiler system. The first place to start is by replacing the filter at the beginning of the season and every couple of months while you run the furnace. When purchasing a new filter, note that the cheap ones are made just to protect the furnace fan motor, so make sure to get a more efficient and healthy pleated filter for improved air quality.
A tune-up is a good way to cut down on energy, prevent carbon monoxide leaks, and keep the air inside your home safe and healthy for you and your family. A tune-up should be a top priority, especially given that your furnace or boiler system will be running at full blast for months to come — you don’t want it to give out right when you need it the most! While the cost of a tune-up may at first glance seem like an unnecessary expenditure, keep in mind that small problems can easily turn into much larger, expensive replacements down the road. A new furnace is a substantial financial investment — regular maintenance postpones its replacement.

Windows that are unsuited for a home’s local climate can be a big contributor to inefficiency. If you live in an area that gets especially cold in the winter, investing in windows with insulated glass that’s double-paned or even triple-paned has the potential to transform the comfort of your home and your energy bill.
There are three main types of windows that are available on the market today and they include single-pane, double-pane, and super-triple-pane windows. Single- and double- pane windows are common in older houses, but windows in newer homes are commonly treated with Low-emittance (low-E) coatings (this can include both super windows and double pane windows). Low-E coatings are microscopically thin, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window to suppress radiative heat flow. The coating keeps radiant heat on the same side of the glass from which it originated, all while letting visible light pass — which means in the winter heat is reflected in, and in the summer heat is reflected out. Different types of Low-E coatings have been designed to allow for high solar gain, moderate solar gain, or low solar gain, and their application will depend on what region your home is located.
Super windows are a more recent development that feature a third pane of treated glass, and in some cases boast a krypton/argon/air gas mix in between the panes. When it comes to thermal performance, these windows are second to none and they can reduce your energy bill by hundreds of dollars. The choices can be daunting when selecting new windows and payback long, so make sure to do diligent research and ‘ tune’ your windows to take advantage of solar heat.
While new windows would be great for everyone, we understand that they are a hefty investment that require a lot of technical analysis from a skilled professional. Moreover, new windows can often be just marginally more efficient than old ones (compared to your wall’s r-value for instance). Energy efficiency is about looking at the home as a system, and this is a long-term investment you shouldn’t be hasty or thrifty about. Get an energy audit before you make the plunge into making any window replacement.
With that said, there are many improvements that you can make to what you already have. They require just a little effort, but can pay out big in cash savings and improved comfort. More simple remedies can easily be found on the shelves of your local hardware store. Purchase some caulk and cellular shades (insulating blinds) to really increase efficiency. Use caulk to seal the window frame, and then setup your cellular shades . These shades are easy to install and work by creating pockets of air to insulate windows from the cold. A good set of shades can double or triple a window’s performance making these a no brainier for winter comfort and energy savings. TIP 7: Install a Smart Thermostat
Ok, so you got through the grunt work, now its time to put in some sexy technology to really save some energy. Programmable thermostats (or t-stats) have gotten a bad rap for being difficult to use, and the EPA has yanked their Energy Star designation as a result. However, there are new, much more intuitive designs out there, like the Wi-Fi enabled Honeywell t-stat . Honeywell’s model not only lets you control the device from your iPhone or computer, but it tells you when there are significant temperature swings coming and even when the filter needs to be changed.
Programmable thermostats come in many varieties and price ranges, and getting one can save the average household about $180 a year if it’s used right. The idea is simple: these smart devices allow you to optimize your home’s energy-efficiency by setting pre-programmed temperatures for different situations, seasons and times. For example, you probably don’t want to be paying for heat during the day when you’re not even there, right? You can set your programmable thermostat to automatically turn down the heat during those hours and turn it up when you and your family come home to save money and energy.

"Byrne: What the numbers say about Patriots' playoff chances Kerry J. Byrne Wednesday, January 06, 2016 Credit: AP Bill Belichick comments Tweet Passer rating differential is the most reliable indicator of championship potential in all of North American sports. It’s the mother of all stats.
And the picture she paints for the Patriots is a hazy, confusing splotch of pigskin impressionism. With a full complement of weapons early in the season, the Pats were one of the NFL’s dominant statistical powers. The trend since then has been sharply downward, a spiral that began not with the 2-4 record since Thanksgiving but as early as Week 6.
The Patriots reached their statistical peak following their 30-6 rout of Dallas in Week 5. They emerged from that game plus-37.8 in PRD, yet they enter the playoffs a mere plus-14.9, their lowest mark of the entire campaign. Put another way, they enter the postseason as statistically suspect as they’ve looked all year.
But here’s the good news for Patriots fans: The team still is ranked No. 6 in the NFL in PRD. And that offers plenty of statistical confidence.
Passer rating differential simply measures the disparity between offensive passer rating and defensive passer rating (or the efficiency of all opposing quarterbacks against a team’s defense).
The importance of this indicator throughout NFL history cannot be understated, as 27-of-75 league champs (36 percent) since 1940 finished No. 1 in PRD, 45 (60 percent) ranked in the top three and 71 (94.7 percent) were in the top 10.
Week in and week out, year after year, decade after decade, the teams that dominate the battle of passing efficiency dominate on the scoreboard and in the standings. The 2015 season was no exception: The teams that produced the top 103 performances in PRD were an incredible 100-3.
The Patriots were 9-1 when they won the battle of passing efficiency. Their 2-4 stumble at the finish line coincided with — indeed was caused by — an inability to consistently win the battle of pass efficiency. But hope is not lost.
The AFC playoff field is, statistically speaking, among the weakest in history, with three flawed contenders (Broncos, Steelers, Texans) and two that look statistically stout but have poor postseason histories and huge question marks at quarterback (Bengals, Chiefs). None possesses the historic statistical profile of an NFL champion.
Here’s a look at the PRD profile of each AFC contender, plus a quick look at the field of NFC contenders, with a special focus on how each team has trended in the mother of all stats.
Cincinnati : The Bengals were the most consistent statistical force in the AFC. They started strong with a plus-30.2 PRD in their dominant Week 1 win against Oakland and rarely wavered. They enter the playoffs plus-25.2, best in the AFC. But Cincy has huge questions at QB: Injured starter Andy Dalton is 0-4 in his postseason career with a dismal 57.8 passer rating. Backup A.J. McCarron has started just three NFL games.
Kansas City : The Chiefs are the hottest team in the AFC, both on the scoreboard. They’ve won 10 straight and have trended upward in PRD every week of the streak. Their plus-19.4 PRD is No. 2 in the AFC. The Chiefs pair the second-best pass defense in football (76.0 defensive passer rating) with hugely efficient QB Alex Smith. But Smith has limited playoff experience: He’s 1-2 in 10 NFL seasons.
Denver : The Broncos are a statistical anomaly, going 12-4 with the AFC’s No. 1 seed despite habitually poor QB play and a PRD of minus-2.5. Only two teams in NFL history were upside-down in PRD and won a championship: the 1957 Lions and the 2007 Giants, who upset the unbeaten Patriots.
Denver statistically peaked in Week 2 (plus-29.2 PRD) while Peyton Manning threw 17 interceptions in just 10 games. And his playoff record is spottier than a Dalmatian with measles. Manning’s normally high-powered teams have averaged a dismal 15.2 points in his 13 career playoff losses. Don’t count on him to deliver this year, either.
Pittsburgh : The Steelers were consistently mediocre in 2015 and enter the postseason plus-0.30 in PRD, 16th in the NFL. Only one team in history won a championship with a PRD ranking worse than 12th: the 2007 Giants (24th).
Ben Roethlisberger put up big numbers but threw 16 picks in just 12 games, and he’s paired with a mediocre pass defense. It’s a bad combo. Pittsburgh’s six Super Bowl champs all were dominant in PRD. This team is not.
Houston : The Texans enter the playoffs plus-2.5 in PRD, their best mark of the season. Houston pairs a slightly above-average pass defense with a below-average passing game led by unproven Brian Hoyer (26 career starts). That combination spells an early playoff exit.
The NFC field : The Seahawks surged through the second half of the season behind an increasingly tough defense and the league’s most efficient QB in Russell Wilson (110.1 passer rating). They topped the NFL in PRD for just the second time in franchise history. The first was in 2013 when, not coincidentally, they won the Super Bowl.
The 15-1 Panthers finished No. 2 in PRD, while the statistically powerful Cardinals topped the PRD leaderboard much of the season before finishing fourth.
Bottom line for the Pats: Despite the long period of statistical struggles and with a slew of injured players returning for the playoffs, they are no worse than a 50-50 proposition to win the AFC and return to the Super Bowl for a seventh time in the Tom Brady era.
But don’t count on the Patriots to win it all. NFC powers Seattle, Carolina and Arizona would be — and should be — favored to beat the Patriots in Super Bowl 50.

"Byrne: Pats' chances rate with best Kerry J. Byrne Wednesday, January 06, 2016 Credit: AP Bill Belichick comments Tweet Passer rating differential is the most reliable indicator of championship potential in all of North American sports. It’s the mother of all stats.
And the picture she paints for the Patriots is a hazy, confusing splotch of pigskin impressionism. With a full complement of weapons early in the season, the Pats were one of the NFL’s dominant statistical powers. The trend since then has been sharply downward, a spiral that began not with the 2-4 record since Thanksgiving but as early as Week 6.
The Patriots reached their statistical peak following their 30-6 rout of Dallas in Week 5. They emerged from that game plus-37.8 in PRD, yet they enter the playoffs a mere plus-14.9, their lowest mark of the entire campaign. Put another way, they enter the postseason as statistically suspect as they’ve looked all year.
But here’s the good news for Patriots fans: The team still is ranked No. 6 in the NFL in PRD. And that offers plenty of statistical confidence.
Passer rating differential simply measures the disparity between offensive passer rating and defensive passer rating (or the efficiency of all opposing quarterbacks against a team’s defense).
The importance of this indicator throughout NFL history cannot be understated, as 27-of-75 league champs (36 percent) since 1940 finished No. 1 in PRD, 45 (60 percent) ranked in the top three and 71 (94.7 percent) were in the top 10.
Week in and week out, year after year, decade after decade, the teams that dominate the battle of passing efficiency dominate on the scoreboard and in the standings. The 2015 season was no exception: The teams that produced the top 103 performances in PRD were an incredible 100-3.
The Patriots were 9-1 when they won the battle of passing efficiency. Their 2-4 stumble at the finish line coincided with — indeed was caused by — an inability to consistently win the battle of pass efficiency. But hope is not lost.
The AFC playoff field is, statistically speaking, among the weakest in history, with three flawed contenders (Broncos, Steelers, Texans) and two that look statistically stout but have poor postseason histories and huge question marks at quarterback (Bengals, Chiefs). None possesses the historic statistical profile of an NFL champion.
Here’s a look at the PRD profile of each AFC contender, plus a quick look at the field of NFC contenders, with a special focus on how each team has trended in the mother of all stats.
Cincinnati: The Bengals were the most consistent statistical force in the AFC. They started strong with a plus-30.2 PRD in their dominant Week 1 win against Oakland and rarely wavered. They enter the playoffs plus-25.2, best in the AFC. But Cincy has huge questions at QB: Injured starter Andy Dalton is 0-4 in his postseason career with a dismal 57.8 passer rating. Backup A.J. McCarron has started just three NFL games.
Kansas City: The Chiefs are the hottest team in the AFC, both on the scoreboard. They’ve won 10 straight and have trended upward in PRD every week of the streak. Their plus-19.4 PRD is No. 2 in the AFC. The Chiefs pair the second-best pass defense in football (76.0 defensive passer rating) with hugely efficient QB Alex Smith. But Smith has limited playoff experience: He’s 1-2 in 10 NFL seasons.
Denver: The Broncos are a statistical anomaly, going 12-4 with the AFC’s No. 1 seed despite habitually poor QB play and a PRD of minus-2.5. Only two teams in NFL history were upside-down in PRD and won a championship: the 1957 Lions and the 2007 Giants, who upset the unbeaten Patriots.
Denver statistically peaked in Week 2 (plus-29.2 PRD) while Peyton Manning threw 17 interceptions in just 10 games. And his playoff record is spottier than a Dalmatian with measles. Manning’s normally high-powered teams have averaged a dismal 15.2 points in his 13 career playoff losses. Don’t count on him to deliver this year, either.
Pittsburgh: The Steelers were consistently mediocre in 2015 and enter the postseason plus-0.30 in PRD, 16th in the NFL. Only one team in history won a championship with a PRD ranking worse than 12th: the 2007 Giants (24th).
Ben Roethlisberger put up big numbers but threw 16 picks in just 12 games, and he’s paired with a mediocre pass defense. It’s a bad combo. Pittsburgh’s six Super Bowl champs all were dominant in PRD. This team is not.
Houston: The Texans enter the playoffs plus-2.5 in PRD, their best mark of the season. Houston pairs a slightly above-average pass defense with a below-average passing game led by unproven Brian Hoyer (26 career starts). That combination spells an early playoff exit.
The NFC field: The Seahawks surged through the second half of the season behind an increasingly tough defense and the league’s most efficient QB in Russell Wilson (110.1 passer rating). They topped the NFL in PRD for just the second time in franchise history. The first was in 2013 when, not coincidentally, they won the Super Bowl.
The 15-1 Panthers finished No. 2 in PRD, while the statistically powerful Cardinals topped the PRD leaderboard much of the season before finishing fourth.
Bottom line for the Pats: Despite the long period of statistical struggles and with a slew of injured players returning for the playoffs, they are no worse than a 50-50 proposition to win the AFC and return to the Super Bowl for a seventh time in the Tom Brady era.
But don’t count on the Patriots to win it all. NFC powers Seattle, Carolina and Arizona would be — and should be — favored to beat the Patriots in Super Bowl 50.

"TOXIN loss vs. WEIGHT loss

Weight is just that...WEIGHT. Your scale has no idea WHAT it is measuring, it is simply measuring the mass of whatever you are putting on it. If that is your body, your scale will calculate the mass of your body with it's current toxins, water percentage, undigested food, built-up fecal matter etc., and when this number starts going up or down, your scale has ZERO ability to tell you what exactly you've lost or gained. But, we FLIP OUT if that number reaches a range that we have always told ourselves we wouldn't get to, right? The problem is our focus is on the wrong area of our body -- the OUTSIDE.

Society has painted this picture that weight loss should be our general focus when trying to improve our health. When you rid the body of toxins, healthy weight loss can also occur but it will do so naturally.

See, weight gain never shows up to the party alone. It always brings one or more of its friends such as inflammation, decreased energy, inability to control cravings for junk food or sodas/coffee/alcohol, depression, anxiety, heart disease, diabetes, IBS, insomnia, stress, and much more.

Do you know the probable ROOT of all of these issues? Gut health. Your gut is responsible for a great deal of your immune function and your serotonin levels. It is also responsible for properly processing toxins through the body and out where they belong. If your gut is not properly eliminating these toxins, or if they are LEAKING into your system (Leaky Gut Syndrome -- Google it), then your body will not be balanced and will begin to spiral out of control.

Try to switch your focus to your INSIDES for a while and see what incredible changes can happen!

"January 07, 2016 – ExposingTheSecret.net, a health and wellness company dedicated to offering the best supplements available on the market today, proudly announces the availability of Zurvita’s nationally recognized Zeal For Life health supplement products at their website.
Zeal For Life’s Zeal Wellness has been described as a premium health food store wrapped up in a single all-in-one product. It is the only healthy nutritional supplement product most people will ever need.
Image: http://exposingthesecret.net/wp-content/uploads/real-zeal-wellness.png
Zeal for Life is a functional whole food product line designed to improve mental clarity, provide an abundance of natural energy, assist with achieving weight loss goals, and give people more energy and a zeal for life. The cornerstone of the product line is Zeal Wellness, which is filled with more than 120 beneficial nutrients, some of which are difficult to get anywhere else. Zeal Wellness is so concentrated and powerful that it would take 56 different pills, capsules and powdered supplements in order to get the variety and quantity of nutrients found in a single serving of Zeal Wellness.
“Using strict evaluation criteria, the only products we have ever carried are items that provide documented benefits and give people good value for their money,” said Frank Dockweiler, owner of ExposingTheSecret.net. “In 2015, after running Zurvita’s products through our own independent tests, we became consultants for Zurvita , the formulator of the Zeal for Life product line. We were so impressed with these products and the company that we made a bold move to dramatically increase the market visibility of the Zeal for Life product line. In 2016, we are excitedly training other people to become Zurvita consultants, allowing them to work remotely from their homes full or part-time and build an independent business. This allows us to enable a greater number of people to experience more zeal for life than we could ever help all by ourselves.”
Video Link: http://www.youtube.com/embed/fJKmdJepdcE

By Prof. Brad Reid - Guest Blogger We've greatly admired Brad's articles for the Huffington Post , and asked him to guest blog for prisonist.org . Violating a federal fraud statute easily becomes a personal and business disaster. Many years ago I provided commercial banking legal representation to a bank president. One day, out of the blue, he asked me to backdate some documents. Thankfully, I declined. Some years after I entered the academic world, he and the bank's leadership team were convicted of federal fraud offenses. Additionally, the bank collapsed. A number of families were devastated. The president was an energetic businessman and doubtless never imagined this outcome to his career. What happened? My observation, at a distance, is that he was caught-up in the emotional high of great success and came to believe that cutting a few corners was okay because rapid growth would cover any issues. The "just this once" rationalization is a powerful seduction.Sometimes, individuals stumble into legal violations that may occur very rapidly, on the spur of the moment. See, for example, #12 on the list below. I think that we all need support systems and sources of affirmation that are not simply measured in dollars. When we know that we are valued and respected for simply being ourselves, it becomes easier to resist the temptations of illicit and illegal gratifications. Reciprocal love and concern is both a powerful preventive and provides powerful healing. Our networks of family and friends are priceless.This blog provides a brief and incomplete educational overview of common federal fraud offenses. In the interest of brevity, specific punishments and/or civil penalties and potential private lawsuits for each offense are not discussed. Note that many contemporary statutes have anti-retaliation and whistleblower protection provisions, also not discussed. Many federal statutes have a state statutory equivalent. It does not violate double jeopardy for prosecutors to pursue both federal and state criminal offenses. Always consult an experienced attorney in specific personal and business situations.1. Mail fraud and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, 1343) have become widely utilized and ever-adaptable general purpose federal offenses. As judicially interpreted, proof of mail fraud requires a scheme or artifice to defraud involving the mailing of a letter for the purpose of attempting or actually executing the scheme. Specific intent to defraud must be proven and the falsity must be material (influencing a reasonable person). "Mail" includes both public and private carriers, such as UPS or FedEx, and the item need not cross state lines (may be intrastate). The use of mail is broadly interpreted so, for example, the fraudulent use of an employer's credit card and resulting mailed statements satisfies the mail requirement. Every act of mailing is a separate offense. Additionally, it is a separate offense to use a fictitious name in schemes involving the Postal Service (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1342).Wire fraud is closely related to mail fraud but includes virtually all media including radio, television, facsimile, telex, internet, and email.2. Bank fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344) involves attempting or executing a scheme to defraud a federally insured financial institution. This includes funds, securities, or any property owned by or in the custody of the institution. The institution need not suffer an actual loss. It is enough for the institution to be at risk of civil liability. Liability occurs in a broad array of situations involving, for example, check offenses, false statements on loan applications, credit card fraud, student loan fraud, ATM fraud, vehicle title fraud, mortgage fraud, fraudulent credit card receipts, and "shell" bank transactions.3. Bankruptcy fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 157) requires proof of a scheme or attempt to defraud involving a petition, document, or any fraudulent representation in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding. A number of related offenses involve mail and wire fraud, tax fraud, money laundering, perjury, and Sarbanes-Oxley offenses such as destroying, altering, or falsification of records.4. Health care fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344, 1347) requires proof of a scheme or attempt to defraud any health care benefit program (public or private). This includes the delivery or payment for services. Additionally, there is a separate statute (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320) involving making false statements to obtain payments from a federal health care program. Related offenses involve the federal False Claims Act and making false statements. The Stark Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395) provides a complex set of regulations generally prohibiting physician referrals to entities (such as rehabilitation centers) in which a physician or immediate family member has a financial interest.5. Securities legislation (15 U.S.C. Sec 77a and related provisions) contains numerous antifraud provisions related to the purchase and sale of investments whose return to the investor is primarily dependent of the efforts of a third party. "Security" is a broad term, including Florida citrus groves in a famous 1946 Supreme Court case (S.E.C. v. W.J. Howey Co.). Trading on nonpublic "insider information" (information that will influence the price of a security) is one example of a commonly charged offense.6. The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. Sec. 3729) is frequently applied to Medicare, Medicaid, and defense contractor fraud. The statute involves fines and civil penalties for knowingly making or conspiring to make false financial claims to the government. The original legislation was signed by President Lincoln to address fraudulent Union Army suppliers. "Knowingly" includes actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or reckless disregard for the truth. Each false statement on a bill may be a separate offense. Private individuals may sue on behalf of the federal government in a "qui tam" (short for a Latin phrase 'who as well as for the king as for himself sues') action and receive a reward. Corporate inside whistleblowers may act. Potential false claims include billing, false affirmative certifications of compliance with regulations or conditions, or claims that implicitly represent compliance with contract terms, regulations, or statutes. A "worthless services" standard involves providing services that are so deficient as to be the equivalent of no performance.7. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 78dd-1) prohibits direct or indirect payments to foreign officials or governments to gain business advantages such as contracts. It broadly applies to U.S. companies, subsidiaries, and companies listed on stock exchanges, or that must file reports with the SEC. "Foreign" is also broadly defined and includes international charitable or regulatory organizations. Internal accounting controls are required as well as compliance programs. Lawful payments under foreign law and bona fide promotional expenses are allowed but narrowly interpreted. Companies are liable for actions by intermediaries. Certain facilitating or "grease" payments to minor foreign officials are allowed, but narrowly interpreted. Successor companies may be liable for the actions of a predecessor.8. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7201 and related provisions) contains eleven "Titles," each with sections, enacted in reaction to corporate scandals such as Enron. Only the broadest of overviews is possible in this brief comment. Private boards, accounting firms, and public agencies have additional responsibilities. It regulates auditor independence and mandates enhanced financial disclosures. Criminal penalties are imposed on the manipulation, destruction, or alteration of financial records or the interference with investigations. It also has whistleblower protections. Executives must certify the accuracy of a variety of financial statements and tax returns. In 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court reversed (5:4) the conviction under a federal false record provision (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1519) of a commercial fisherman. The fisherman ordered a crew member to toss undersized fish overboard to prevent their detection by federal authorities (Yates v. U.S.). The application of Sarbanes-Oxley continues to unfold.9. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. Sec 5301) was enacted in response to the Great Recession. It amends the regulatory structure and contains sixteen "Titles," each with sections. Only the broadest of overviews is possible in this brief comment. It is designed to achieve greater Wall Street transparency and accountability, investor protection, and mortgage reform. At intervals, executive compensation is subject to shareholder vote. A variety of financial derivatives regulations have been enacted or are pending before the SEC. A Constitutional challenge to Dodd-Frank is active in the federal court system. The unfolding of Dodd-Frank continues.10. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030) prohibits obtaining national security information, compromising computer confidentiality, accessing a computer to defraud, damaging transmissions or access, password trafficking, and extortion involving threats to damage a computer. Cell phones may be considered computers. The statute also allows a civil lawsuit for economic damages greater than $5,000 but some courts have not allowed recovery for lost personal contact information, photos, and text messages generally.11. Immigration fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1546) involves the fraudulent use of immigration documents such as visas, border crossing cards, and permits. A variety of federal agencies have regulatory authority. Employers may find legal issues associated with undocumented workers, workers who have overstayed a valid visa, or applications for permanent alien labor certifications when the employer or industry generally has terminated or furloughed workers in a same or similar position within the past six months.12. Making a material false statement to a federal official or a false record entry (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001), even if not in court or otherwise under oath, is a criminal offense. The contact might be with an investigator or very casual. One has the legal right to remain silent but not to lie. Anticipate that an investigator already knows the answer to the question being asked. This provision convicted Martha Stewart and appears in many situations where the prosecutor is unable to prove an underlying offense, such as securities fraud, that is the actual subject of the investigation. The U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark 1998 decision, Brogan v. U.S., said that one does not have the legal right to an "exculpatory no" (a false denial of guilt) under this provision.13. Another, primary state issue, under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, involves fraudulent conveyances. While this may occur in the context of bankruptcy, the statutes are broad enough to encompass any activity designed to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. The courts typically discuss "badges of fraud" that include ownership transfers to family members or insiders, inadequate consideration or lack of "reasonably equivalent value" (inadequate payment), continuing to use the item transferred, the existence or threat of litigation, becoming insolvent as a result of the transfer, secrecy, and the overall chronology and circumstances. The look-back period in which such transfers are invalidated depends upon the specific legislation and circumstances and may be as long as six years. Proving intent to defraud may be unnecessary and some cases consider gifts to charities. Leveraged buyouts, where a company borrows on its assets and purchases stock, may sometime be the subject of a fraudulent conveyance claim.A common legal defense to a fraud statute involves the defendant's "good faith belief" that the asserted fraudulent representations were true. However, "scienter" (intent to deceive) is not always required to trigger liability. The statute of limitations (time in which to bring a case) for federal fraud statutes is frequently five years but may be ten years if a financial institution is involved. A "continuing offense" may expand this time period beyond the original commission of the unlawful conduct. Federal Courts of Appeal disagree as to whether the statute of limitations for mail and wire fraud begins on the date of the communication or the date of completion of the scheme.This blog provides a brief and incomplete educational overview of a complex topic and is not intended to provide legal advice.

Thats really good, but did you check the using the bulb ground or engine ground? I ask because some of those systems are ground-switched. meaning the bulbs have Pos(+) at all times and the ground runs into the switch or lighting controller. There would be your voltage drop. You can simply measure from the bulb ground to the engine ground and any voltage shown is your voltage drop. _________________________ -Colton 2002 Ford Crown Vic PI, 174k "Highwayman" (Ex-Kootenai County, ID Unit #42)

Originally Posted By: dparm The only real leg-up anyone has is with stuff like the NightBreaker which has a more efficient and smaller filament, meaning you get more focused (and less wasted) light. In my experience, Consumer Reports is right that most upgrade bulbs don't offer a significant improvement. There will be some (especially if your car has the original long life bulbs still in it). But it's not dramatic. Most of the better upgrade bulbs have a completely clear glass envelope. This is good (no light-stealing filters), but it also indicates that the bulb still produces legal levels of light. The bulbs that offer the most improvement are those like the Philips Xtreme Power/Xtreme Vision and Osram Nightbreaker. Look closely: they have a thin blue filter ring at the very front of the bulb. Contrary to popular belief, this blue ring isn't there to color the light for ricers. It's there to steal away some of the bulb's output to keep the bulb in the allowable range of output. But it does so at the very FRONT of the bulb, where the light is largely unused anyway (being taken up by the glare shield found in front of most bulbs in modern housings). The light output from bulbs is measured in an Integrating Sphere (Wikipedia link). An integrating sphere measures total output of the light source without respect to spatial direction. In other words, it doesn't matter how the light is distributed inside the sphere...it simply measures total flux. Without the thin blue ring on the front of bulbs such as the Philips Xtreme range and the Osram Nightbreaker, these bulbs would produce extra-legal levels of light. I say all that to note that although these two bulbs (and perhaps some others) are street legal bulbs, they do produce more of a performance improvement than otherwise possible because of this thin blue ring, which again removes light from areas which aren't used by the housing anyway. These bulbs stand out from the crowded arena of clear-glass upgrade bulbs (and are certainly superior to bulbs with full color filters like the Sylvania Silverstar, GE Nighthawk Sport, etc). Consumer Reports did not test either the Philips Xtreme Vision or the Osram Nightbreaker. If they had, I believe they would have found more of a performance improvement. All of this performance improvement, obviously, is at the expense of life. There is no free lunch. _________________________ Cheers, Jason 2009 Honda Ridgeline RTL 2005 Acura MDX Touring

The HTHS test and the Kurt Oban shear test are two distinct tests. The KO test pushes oil through a fuel injector to induce permanent shearing of the oil. Once the test is complete, you simply measure the standard kinematic viscosity of the oil at 100C. The result is then compared to the lower KV100 limit of your vis grade (12.5 min for an 5W40 or 9.3 min for a 5W30. I suspect if you took the sheared oil from KO and put it through HTHS it might be lower than normal but I've never run that test. As you might expect, running a 90 cycle KO is more extreme than a 30 cycle test. It's not, as you might expect, three times more extreme as there's a limit to how much you can chew up VI molecules. Shellvis VI is 'clever' in that it's pretty good on KO30 even though it's relatively poor on HTHS. However if you extend KO out to 90 cycles, its inherent fragility becomes more apparent. Thinking about this, this wouldn't affect 5W30 Euro top tier but 5W40 & 0W40 would be impacted. Euro OCP VIs tend to be far more robust so wouldn't be greatly affected by a switch from 30 to 90 cycles. However, doing top tier with OCP is far from easy as you are dealing with so much more rubber in the oil. Hope this helps...

Labman, if you consider simply measuring the square area as 'data' then I can attest that if you disect 10 Mann-Hummel filters then you'll get the exact same measurement with each filter. If you disect 10 filters that are packaged by the name brands but made in third world countries then you will normally get several different square inch measurements because the quality of manufacturer simply isn't there with Korean and chinese made filters. When you go to buy a Wix filter for your cartridge application you are going to get a Korean filter made by a unknown company of unknown quality reputation. You're paying big dollars for the Wix name yet Wix is paying pennies on the dollar to have those parts made in Asia. It burns my butt to go to buy a filter for my VW and have the parts store charging me dealership prices for a Korean made cheesy filter with the crappiest plastic end caps I've ever seen. The paper media is going to be a proprietary composite compound and unless you're a insider you'll never actually know what's going into the filters. This is when you have to use some deductive reasoning to decide if buying cheap parts at full price is giving you the quality you'd get by buying OEM parts for the most expensive automotive engines in the world. I second the recommendation of using Mann-Hummel, Mahle/Knecht, or Hengst. If you want second rate then at least buy a GUD filter from south Africa. Otherwise the debate about filter quality is like comparing feces.. at the end of the day you still have a piece of s@#%. I'll apologize in advance if I offend others. Most people don't recognize quality unless it's on sale at Wal-Mart.

I did the cooler line ATF change method on a Volvo 850. It worked and wasn't a hassle. The procedure was well documented on the 'net so I thought I'd give it a try. I initially waited to see bubbles but by the end of the process I was simply measuring 1 litre out, 1 litre in. I preferred this approach as opposed to letting the TC run dry when I didn't need to. Replacing fluid via the dipstick receiver made the job easier as well.

I separated this out from the thread in which the question was asked specifically to avoid the answer being overrun by folks with other agendas. Explain how a significant portion of a lube flow can go through 1% or less of a media surface. I will accept math, citations to literature, just about anything other than your personal suppositions and uninformed impressions. Then explain how this could occur over thousands of miles with essentially no erosion of the hole in a media with the consistency of a wet paper towel. Then cite examples of bona fide measurements of this actually occurring in actual engines on vehicles or stationary equipment. I've been at this for more than a few weeks and I've never encountered it. There are lots of threads for "the sky is falling" folks to beat their favorite dead horse to death. I started this one to answer a simple question. The answer is and remain "No". Go read the wikipedia article about the scientific method. It has more parts than Hypothesis -> Conclusion which is basically all that you have done. This is my personal favorite of yours, though: "Explain how a significant portion of a lube flow can go through 1% or less of a media surface." I dunno... let me think... maybe the exact same way it got into (and eventually out of) the filter in the first place. I mean, how big exactly is the threaded hole in the bottom of the filters you use, because mine are pretty small. In fact usually six or eight tiny holes are all it takes for the oil to get in and one maybe 1/2" diameter hole to exit. So for all the science you've done it seems you've missed a pretty large point. If all that oil can exit a .25 square inch hole in the metal bottom plate how is it you don't think much of it can go through a .25 square inch hole in the filter media?

We have had this machine for some time and it suits our needs perfectly. It is simple (how I loathe so many bells and whistles on every product nowadays-really, who has the time and energy to use them?) and oh so easy to use. Simply measure your coffee into the filter, pour in the water and presto, your little machine starts perking up a beautiful cup of coffee. This product is manufactured by Sunbeam and I have almost always had good results with this company and theirs is a trustworthy brand name. The 4-cup limit is perfect for most households today-of course, you can make less than that according to your needs. We bought the black model and it has been easy to clean and keep looking nice.

I simply measure out my rice and add the same amount of water plus an extra half cup and I am done. My particular model has digital buttons and an LED readout which is really nice. It tells me when the rice is cooking or just warming. The rice cooker is easy to clean as well because the inner liner is removable. You can make as little as one cup or as much as ten cups of rice so it is also very versatile. My husband is Chinese and we have four children so we are constantly making and eating steamed rice and I can honestly say that this rice cooker can stand up to a lot of use. I have had no problems with it and really like how the lid locks and stays closed throughout the cooking process yet is very easy to open. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves to eat rice.

"Live the healthiest life that you can enjoy - [...] do your best." August 11, 2015 7:12 AM Subscribe Yoni Freedhoff is an assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Ottawa and the founder of the Bariatric Medical Institute which is a multi-disciplinary, ethical, evidence-based nutrition and weight management centre. Dr. Freedhoff has been referred to as Canada's most outspoken obesity expert and the Canadian Medical Association Journal once dubbed him a Canadian "nutritional watchdog". In other words, he's a respected professional - and he's using that power for good. Sometimes he agrees with Coca Cola . He often points out how hard it is for parents to help their kids make healthy nutritional choices. Do you know how to feed your children? Have you noticed how food is marketed to children in every part of modern society? Prefer to take your science-based diet advice offline? Freedhoff is the author of The Diet Fix – arguably one of the most sane, rational, and reasonable books about food, weight, and diets. How does he approach weight maintenance and loss? "The most important factor in sustaining your weight is not just tolerating, but actually liking your life and being both consistent, and, believe it or not, imperfect. Truly, your job in regard to both weight and health is to live the healthiest life that you can enjoy - in other words, to do your best." ( amazon author interview ) He's also a regular poster on Facebook , Twitter , Google+ , and has an infrequently updated YouTube channel , too. He pops up in the media fairly frequently - including columns at US News & World Report , Psychology Today , and Huffington Post . You may not be able to have Dr. Freedhoff as your own doctor - but he's been trying to help other physicians understand how to work with patients. In 2010 he wrote a book, available to purchase - and which he insisted be available free online. Reading Best Weight: A practical guide to office-based weight management (pdf) might be enough to help more physicians treat patients with respect. His suggestions include: setting up the waiting room with comfortable chairs and removing magazines that encourage unhealthy eating; providing appropriate gowns, scales and blood pressure cuffs in the exam room; not using scare tactics or stock phrases when discussing weight; the physical and mental barriers to weight loss; and identifying a patient's "best weight" which, ultimately, isn't based on a specific number. posted by VioletU (47 comments total) 60 users marked this as a favorite I already follow his blog and had no idea he was so well known and experienced. Thanks for all the links! posted by aclevername at 7:23 AM on August 11 Great post! The Diet Fix was a life changer for me. the message to live the healthiest life that you enjoy was such a turnaround from the usual message that short term suffering and self-hatred will lead to transformation. posted by arcticwoman at 7:35 AM on August 11 [ 1 favorite ] Ok, so it isn't exactly a Brutal Crossfit WOD, but I think it's a good idea to advocate for healthy alternatives to not moving around much when it's such a low-stakes option (elevator vs stairs). I think we should advocate for having better stairs in office buildings. None of that hot heavy air, carpeted stairs crap. posted by oceanjesse at 7:45 AM on August 11 [ 2 favorites ] I think we should advocate for having better stairs in office buildings. Taking the elevator may kill you slowly, but providing lots of ventilation to a set of fire stairs will kill you pretty quickly. posted by yerfatma at 7:48 AM on August 11 [ 18 favorites ] Ok, so it isn't exactly a Brutal Crossfit WOD, but I think it's a good idea to advocate for healthy alternatives to not moving around much when it's such a low-stakes option (elevator vs stairs). Yes, but this is a post about losing weight, and taking the stairs is a really really stupid way to try and lose weight. As one of the links says, you would have to climb 122 flights of stairs to make up for eating a Snickers bar. And most people, after that 122 flights, will want a Snickers. From the link: And stopping taking the stairs would be a shame given that when it comes to health, exercise is the world's best drug - it's just not a weight loss drug - and tying stair climbing (or any exercise) to calorie burning rather than health, misinforms the public about both. posted by zabuni at 7:49 AM on August 11 [ 10 favorites ] He had me at this: You know what else has a "delicious buttery taste"? Frickin' BUTTER! Also, the science. The delicious, buttery science. And reasonable advice that's realistic for real people : ...my life is hugely conducive to exercise. My office has a gym and showers. I'm my own boss and consequently didn't run into trouble when I blocked off slots during my work week to exercise. I don't work shifts. I have my health. I'm not injured. My family is healthy. I'm married to an incredibly supportive spouse. We're financially stable. We have access to childcare when we need it. In short, I'm incredibly fortunate and incredibly privileged (and incredibly thankful), and while surely I could have exercised more, I couldn't have done so without that more becoming negative. That said, there are those who can and do enjoy more. And of those great exercisers, some are filled to the brim with self-righteous sanctimony and assert that because they themselves are capable of exercising in large enough quantities to impact their weights, so too could everyone else. But those people, undoubtedly, don't work with the general public on lifestyle change. Because if they did work with the general public they would understand that for most people, real-life challenges, concerns, and responsibilities often understandably trump finding 3.5 or more hours a week to enjoy moderate or greater intensity exercise. Whether it's caregiver responsibilities, co-existing medical illnesses, mental health concerns, severe financial strain, holding down multiple jobs, chronic pain, chronic child or parental mental or physical health problems - these issues and more, definitely, fairly, and rightly challenge the luxury of enjoying large quantities of intentional exercise. My exercise mantra remains the same. Some is good. More is Better. Everything counts. And the good news too is that lesser amounts of exercise, while unlikely to have a dramatic impact upon your weight, may well have a dramatic impact upon your health, mood, sleep, and quality of life, all the while preserving your functional independence as you age. We need to consciously stop tying exercise to weight as its lack of affect therein and/or the incredibly large amounts required to affect it, might well lead a person to give up, or never start exercising, yet exercise, at any weight, might as well be magic when it comes to health. Some is good. More is better. Everything counts. posted by mandolin conspiracy at 7:56 AM on August 11 [ 21 favorites ] I am sick and tired of hearing shit like "Be happy! Love yourself!" Happiness is simply not an option for millions of people. Self-respect is off the table. It's just not going to happen. Freedhoff needs to check his privilege. posted by Faint of Butt at 8:01 AM on August 11 [ 4 favorites ] might want to read the bit that mandolin conspiracy quoted--he has an acute awareness of his privilege, and his message doesn't boil down to "be happy love yourself." posted by feckless fecal fear mongering at 8:11 AM on August 11 [ 18 favorites ] "Take the stairs" isn't necessarily good for you if you're carrying a lot of excess weight, and is pretty ableist when you think about it. Some people are not able to take the stairs without pain or doing great damage to their knees; it's not a moral issue. posted by SassHat at 8:13 AM on August 11 [ 5 favorites ] I literally can't tell if Faint of Butt's comment is ironic or just very American posted by DoctorFedora at 8:17 AM on August 11 [ 29 favorites ] Same, but for the entire thread. posted by Ian A.T. at 8:18 AM on August 11 [ 2 favorites ] This is quickly turning into the most Metafilter thread ever, but thank you VioletU for making this post. Dr. Freedhoff's approach reads as refreshingly pragmatic. posted by indubitable at 8:21 AM on August 11 [ 17 favorites ] I haven't read most of your links yet but I just read the one about feeding kids and it was great, and just what I needed to read right now. Thanks for posting, I will be reading more of this. posted by gerstle at 8:23 AM on August 11 I'm generally an advocate of taking the stairs but I live eight floors up and by the time you do eight double flights of small stairs you are going to be dizzy and out of breath and feel like crap. I run about 5 times a week and I don't take the stairs in my own building because it makes me feel awful. I'm pretty sure making people who are likely in poorer shape than me take the stairs is a recipe for near instant fail plus it rather disastrously simulates heart distress symptoms. I used to take the stairs in my old building when I was three flights up and that actually felt good right up until I had a patella problem. Then I had to take the elevator and I always felt awkward about it because there is no way you can tell someone if someone without a limp is trying to let their knee take it easy for a while. So yeah. Do what you can. Try and stretch what you can achieve a bit every time. Be as mobile as you can for the sake of your long term mobility. Weight loss is more about doing other stuff. Also be sure and check your privilege. It probably won't fit in the overhead compartment. posted by srboisvert at 8:24 AM on August 11 [ 2 favorites ] I fear stairs vs. elevators is going to be added to the list of topics that metafilter doesn't do well. posted by TedW at 8:43 AM on August 11 [ 8 favorites ] Then I had to take the elevator and I always felt awkward about it because there is no way you can tell someone if someone without a limp is trying to let their knee take it easy for a while. Are you saying that you felt you needed to justify your use of an elevator to others or to yourself? I sincerely hope that no one gave you any kind of crap (out loud or just a side-eye) about taking an elevator three floors. It is exactly the reason you state - they have no idea what is going on in your body at that moment. posted by soelo at 8:47 AM on August 11 [ 1 favorite ] I was feeling pretty good about how we structure meal time in my family, and then I get to this in the Do You Know How to Feed Your Children article, "Don't pressure your children to eat (one bite rules are fine), or withhold dessert unless they eat their veggies." We do the first part, and hardly ever have dessert (mainly because if we have desert on hand I eat too much of it), but we definitely tie getting seconds of anything to eating the veggies for the first helping. I guess that needs a rethink. Although, since my kids seem to take genuine pleasure in eating the fruits and vegetables, so I probably don't have to worry too much. posted by Gygesringtone at 8:57 AM on August 11 His junk food fundraising posts are pretty eyebrow-raising: posted by mandolin conspiracy at 8:57 AM on August 11 [ 1 favorite ] Also, this is an amazing amount of information from a resource I didn't know existed.

Stairs are intense, and that goes against "3 hours of moderate exercise" or even just "do your best". Along with probably most people, I take most stairs (at work, at home) at a rate that won't end up with me panting and embarrassing myself at the top of ... 1 flight. They're like wind sprints instead of a steady jog for a mile. Even at the gym, the real stair treadmills are really quite intense. I can go hours on a "step machine" but that stair treadmill had me in 10. Very few people use stairs for 10 flights, and even that's only a few minutes' worth. It's intense. But it's taboo to admit that stairs are hard. They're part of almost everyone's daily life, right? It should embarrass you if you avoid stairs, right? The easiest way to add exercise is just to take the stairs, right? Do you feel the shame? Fuck "just take the stairs". posted by Dashy at 9:40 AM on August 11 [ 10 favorites ] I've lost 50 pounds in the past six months by following the advice of DietDoctor.com.

I joined a gym a few months back, and I've actually gained weight. (I don't think it's fat, though.) My pre-existing fat seems to have moved around a bit, but it didn't disappear. The only way to consistently lose weight is use more calories than you take in over a significant period of time, and that requires either: 1. A whole lot of exercise every day, or 2. dietary restriction, or both. In a way, it's a good thing that exercise doesn't burn fat more efficiently. If it did we'd all be in constant danger of literally starving to death. posted by Kevin Street at 10:43 AM on August 11 [ 3 favorites ] Also, "Exercise is the world's best drug - it's just not a weight loss drug" is a wonderful phrasing of a wonderful concept. posted by jaguar at 10:50 AM on August 11 [ 12 favorites ] I don't think the stairs vs elevator/escalator is the real issue. By opting for "stairs" one is saying "yeah, i understand the importance of being more active in my daily life". So take the elevator all day, every day. But if you are exercising on a regular basis, the elevator vs. stairs thing is moot. It's a way of getting sedentary people to be less sedentary...it's not like they are more likely to accept "walk or bike to work". So you gotta go for the stairs vs. elevator stuff. Baby steps....on the stairs. posted by hal_c_on at 11:02 AM on August 11 [ 1 favorite ] I've lost 50 pounds in the past six months by following the advice of DietDoctor.com.

Perhaps you're blessed, but most people are going to have worse cravings after splurging, not less. Honestly, if most people were like you, we wouldn't have an epidemic of dieters who constantly take off and put on the same weight over and over again. How many people reading this have successfully dieted only to regain all their weight, because they decided to reward themselves with just one treat? That's because that treat woke up their cravings and caused them to jump back into their old eating habits, so for anyone trying to lose weight, simply measure your cravings before you eat the sugary food (high carb, whatever) and then measure your cravings again an hour later. BTW, when I said sugar, I also meant high carb, but they usually go together. Basically, anything sweet tasting is going to trigger cravings. The worst offender being soft drinks, because of the caffeine, but even fruit can cause a spike in cravings. posted by Beholder at 11:30 AM on August 11 How many people reading this have successfully dieted only to regain all their weight, because they decided to reward themselves with just one treat?

A decade ago, I lost a substantial chunk of weight I'd accumulated over a decade of immobile indentured cubicle servitude, after losing the beige job and spending a couple years as a building contractor. I'd cashed out a huge 401k and could afford to eat healthy food, and because my schedule was not set by some tiresome middle management drone, I could afford to take a midday thirty minute nap in a corner of the job site when the peaky energy curve that you get when you're dieting valleys out and leaves you groggy. When I went to work for other people again, I lucked out and got a job in a museum with a sprawling campus, and I was salaried, worked long enough hours that I could continue my occasional midday naps and I was on my feet almost nonstop, to the point that I dumped my desk in favor of a tall standing workbench/desk. The weight stayed off, and I moved on and up to another arts world job...that turned out to be more desk-bound than I'd hoped, but I biked between the two facilities I ran and the head office, and had a fair amount of physical work maintaining a giant clock, a huge garden, and tending to old buildings, and I was still doing well when I injured myself on the job and spent six months nearly immobilized by pain. Regained most of my lost weight then, alas. Pulled it together, got the nerve damage under control with physical therapy I could afford because I had a combination of health insurance and money set aside that covered the uncovered stuff, lost a bit of weight, but the job bogged down at the desk, and I was just on the leading edge of a recurrence of the chronic pain when my department merged with another department in the same field, when seniority came up, I was laid off. Thing is, we Western folks love that sort of sports movie attitude where we think it's all just a matter of being gung ho and toughing it out and putting in 105% and otherwise spewing motivational poster bullshit, but having lots of extra time, no money, and a chronic pain issue that I couldn't treat because I couldn't afford to meant that I spent a large chunk of 2013 on my side, until I got lucky again when I spent a week with my family in Georgia, cooking and working around the old family homestead, and, oddly not being in pain because...well, I had to really think about it and then it hit me—I never sat down. Chairs, as it happens, are poisonous to me. The ACA came along and I could work again, largely because I could afford the risk of working in construction with health insurance to cover me if I was hurt on the job. I kept up with the old exercises my physical therapist had given me in 2011, and I cleaned up my weight bench and started lifting weights every other day. I don't "exercise" in the plastic-fantastic American way, where we drive everywhere, then drive to the gym to simulate being an actual person in the world—I treat my truck as an occasionally necessary poison, and I walk to the store, to the library, to the movie theater, or wherever I'm going, and I take my bike when it's a longer distance, or my motorcycle when I can, because there's a physicality to riding a motorcycle that is dynamic in a way a car just isn't. I weigh one pound less than I did in 2006 when I decided I wanted to lose some weight, but I've never been in better shape. I've haven't been more active, on a moment-by-moment basis, since I was a kid. I'm strong enough to kick the door off a car and I carried the old refrigerator out of my current workplace like a backpack. Hell, when I do any tests at the doctor's office, they always think they've picked up the wrong reports because my numbers disagree with what is supposed to be true because I'm a burly dude."Joe, you really need to lose a little weight," say concerned family members, and it's that same old eye-roller because people seem to think that we fat people don't know that we're fat, and that the need to keep on telling us, lest we forget. I've been on that ride before, so I just shrug, but what I'd tell a better informed person is that I am at exactly the best weight and fitness I can achieve right now, with my current financial situation (dire), my current work situation (wildly overbooked as a freelancer), and in terms of energy level throughout work days that vary from heavy construction to computer-bound (learning about the glycemic index in the last few years really helped a lot, though). When I have had the right circumstances to work solely on my health, I've done so, but right now, the equation is more complex...but that doesn't mean that I'm not attentive to my health any more than one is being neglectful of one's finances for not buying a house when one cannot afford a house. When there is space and the resources to improve, I will improve. When you genuinely can't move forward on a goal because the situation isn't just right, there's no shame in that, but we're raised to be ashamed of ourselves, and of our presumed failings, and our supposed moral weaknesses, and that persistent autoerotic shaming, as well as the constant attention from the tut-tut squad, undoes us when "do the best you can" is absolutely good enough for this moment, right here and right now. Really getting things under control is hard. Being a person in the world is hard. Not living somewhere stupid, where you're doomed to be a slave to a car is hard . Not working in sea of cubicles when that's what your fellow countrymen do is hard . Turning down all the treats and indulgences that massive teams of corporate demons have engineered to be as addictive as heroin is hard . Affording good, healthy food that's satisfying and doesn't knock you out in cyclical sugar crashes is hard . Staying motivated, and knowing that you are a good and worthy and noble animal even when you have to compromise and put some things off and plan for when you can do things you need to do, but can't now? Hard . Being right here, right now, fully immersed in the present moment, and being comfortable being whatever we are, no matter what messages we've taken in, even as we intend to change things about our corporeal selves? Hard . Very hard. Worse still, it all calls on us to learn ourselves. My diet will probably not work for you. I could take some smugness in how little sugar I consume, but I just don't like sugar as much as, say, a little room temperature wedge of Gorgonzola Piccante. The life I've built for myself will probably not work for you. The little town in which I live, where I can walk or bike everywhere? I was brought here as a baby. It's just luck that I like it and was never geographically ambitious enough to move elsewhere. I can work in construction because I'm built that way and because my dad taught me how to build things and fix things. What seems simple to me is only simple because I've occupied this place in the world for a very long time. So, if you turn away the "simple" solutions and the easy solutions and the obvious solutions and the medically approved solutions and one weird trick solutions and the solutions with an acre of fine print, you're left with a much harder road, but if you think that you are worth the effort, you're on the journey with the best traveling companion you'll ever find. posted by sonascope at 11:50 AM on August 11 [ 10 favorites ] As an RDN I'm so happy to see Yoni Freedhoff getting some nice press. I'm a long-time reader of his blog and I appreciate the fact that his advice is reasonable, based on scientific research and his experience as a practitioner, is meant for the long term rather than just lose weight now!! (and gain it back later), and takes into account the actual challenges that real people face when they attempt lifestyle change. I've read his book and it is hands-down the best "diet" book I've encountered, in that it is closest to what I tell my own patients, and it's what I've actually seen work in practice among patients who've been successful with long-term weight loss. posted by antinomia at 11:52 AM on August 11 I take the elevator at work because it makes it easier, energy-wise, for me to get through the day. My energy is patchy for reasons that aren't physically apparent (bipolar). I also figured out recently that the reason I hate cardio and have always hated cardio is because two of the main physical results of cardio (breathlessness & raised heart rate) both individually make me really anxious, and the combined effect is hell. Enough to totally negate the famous exercise endorphins that I thought must be made up or I was too perma-depressed to have any of because I always felt worse rather than better after working out. Raised heart rate makes me anxious because it feels like pure anxiety that I've induced myself on purpose. Breathlessness makes me anxious because I developed a complex around sounding out of breath when I was younger. My somewhat-fat-prone and also super-fat-shamey dad, who really really didn't want fat kid, repeatedly shamed me about my fitness level (while we're here, dad, thanks for the eating disorder; it's a shame for you that all your perfectionism, crash dieting and self-denial didn't stop you dying of cancer at 56, but it kinda makes me feel better). I internalised that message as "oh no, if people hear I can't breathe when I've done active stuff they'll know I'm one of those bad fat people who isn't fit", so I started trying to suppress heavy breathing as much as possible. Which, turns out, makes things worse and makes me feel like shit. So when I do cardio, I feel like I can't breathe because I need to breathe more than usual but I've literally forgotten how to breathe normally in that situation so I feel like I can't breathe even more. And also realy anxious. I started lifting with kettlebells a few months ago, and it's the first time I've found exercise I can genuinely keep doing every day without hating it and myself and feeling like shit. And if I hadn't figured this out on my own by pure chance, I would probably have gone to my grave feeling like a gross person who couldn't do anything physical. Because no one was going to challenge the assumption that I felt shitty when I exercised because I was fat and bad and unfit in the first place, and that the only way I could change that would be by pushing through, which I don't ever feel like doing because of how shitty it makes me feel. Strength training, turns out, is awesome. I like that the aim is to be more strong. That jives really nicely with my whole philosophy on my body and the purpose of moving it. And it doesn't feel like a can't-breathe-y punishment, which cardio always has done. Bonus: when it comes to HAES/non-deranged food advice, I'm a huge fan of the Fat Nutritionist 's blog.

"The Movement Lives in Ferguson: Teach For America, Black Leadership, and Disaster Capitalism school privatization
by Drew Franklin
Teach for America is a corporate Trojan Horse that has deeply penetrated the #BlackLivesMatter organization. Brittany Packnett and Deray Mckesson represent the TFAs long game to develop a leadership class of its own  embedded in the upper ranks of an incipient Black movement. #BlackLivesMatter has been fundamentally compromised by the TFA, whose goal is to dissolve school boards, bust teachers' unions, and secure public funding for charter schools.
The Movement Lives in Ferguson: Teach For America, Black Leadership, and Disaster Capitalism
by Drew Franklin
This article previously appeared in Orchestrated Pulse .
For over twenty years TFAs organizational model has been based upon the idea that a college student, fresh from a five-week summer camp, could swoop into a*poor, overcrowded classroom and inspire her students to overcome all barriers of structural inequality.
Former Black Panther Bruce Dixon, in his blog for the Black Agenda Report , asked a provocative question last year when he wrote the headline:  Teach For America Trojan Horse Among Ferguson Activists? 
Whether the muted response*can be attributed to apathy or ignorance of Teach For Americas activities, the organization*carried on with its operation in plain view, and the question seldom came up again.*Today, TFA shows no sign of slowing down. For three days in February, the vanguard of the education reform movement will host its 25th Anniversary Summit in Washington, D.C. Together We Rise is the tagline for the event, for which theyve booked two major downtown venues and three hotels .
The 501(c)(3) non-profit has indeed come a long way since Wendy Kopp founded it in 1990. In its first year, Teach For America had 500 recruits; by 2013, the organization controlled nearly half-a-billion dollars in assets and employed 11,000 teacher corps members in schools across the United States.
Despite mounting evidence that school privatization does more harm than good , in less than three decades TFA has spread their reach to thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia, playing an indispensable role in enabling the proliferation of charter schools  schools run by private businesses with public funding  throughout the country. But it doesnt stop there. Tracing the genealogy of tax-exempt education reform foundations puts Teach For America at the center of a massive scheme, backed by powerful donors, for corporate takeovers of public schools everywhere  not just in the US, but around the world.
Join us, reads the header on TFAs 25th Anniversary Summit web page, to reflect on the progress weve made over the past 25 years as we step forward together to reach One Day. (The capitalized One Day appears to be a reference to the title of Wendy Kopps 2001 memoir about TFAs origins, One Day, All Children... ) Below it, the event description says: Our 25th Anniversary Summit will bring together thousands from the Teach For America community, all united behind a single goal: in our lifetime, every child will have access to a truly excellent education.
Teach For America at the center of a massive scheme, backed by powerful donors, for corporate takeovers of public schools everywhere.
In the past, TFA relied on political alliances with policy makers, like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and DCs ousted mayor Adrian Fenty, to seize control of school districts and impose the charter school model. But the long game  what it calls  the second half*of the movement   is to develop its corps members into a leadership class of its own. Kopp explains :
I think the way to understand Teach for America is as a leadership development program. We need political leaders, policy makers, doctors, lawyers, and probably more business leaders than we are producing right now . . . In the long run, we need to build a leadership force of people. We have a whole strategy around not only providing folks with the foundational experience during their two years with us, but also then accelerating their leadership in ways that is strategic for the broader education reform movement.
By developing corps members into leaders committed to its ideology, TFA has disguised its centrality in*the*education reform movement, spawning a disorienting web of interconnected*but* nominally independent foundations . These organizations, nearly all of them founded or directed by TFA alumni, work together in coordinated campaigns to dissolve school boards , bust teachers unions , and secure public funding for charter schools.
Among them is the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP), an umbrella organization for charter schools founded in 1994 by TFA alumni Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin, which administers 183*schools in cities like New York, D.C., and New Orleans, where education reformers connected to TFA first cleared the way for privatization. KIPPs reputation has earned it the moniker  Kids In Prison Program  for its schools draconian disciplinary policies , giving* new meaning to the term school-to-prison pipeline.
The justification for this epidemic of institutionalized child abuse*in the form of charter schools depends entirely on standardized testing. The No Child Left Behind Act mandated an increase in testing across the United States, and education reformers seized on the achievement gap revealed by the test scores. This metric has been*used, first to justify firing thousands of teachers and principles and closing schools, and then as proof of charter schools effectiveness. But all along the entire premise was bunk. The Texas Observer reports on the work of University of Texas professor Walter Stoup, who in 2012* testified to the*Texas House Public Education Committee that standardized testing was not a*reliable*measure of student aptitude:
Stroup knew from his experience teaching impoverished students in inner-city Boston, Mexico City and North Texas that students could improve their mastery of a subject by more than 15 percent in a school year, but the tests couldnt measure that change. Stroup came to believe that the biggest portion of the test scores that hardly changedthat 72 percentsimply measured test-taking ability. For almost $100 million a year, Texas taxpayers were sold these tests as a gauge of whether schools are doing a good job. Lawmakers were using the wrong tool.
Stroups testimony had little effect,*and it ultimately*cost him his tenure. Meanwhile, Teach For Americas leadership bloc has grown beyond the non-profit sector and is working its way up the ranks of state power. As the Nation reports , More than seventy alumni currently hold public office, including two state senators. Within the federal government, their ranks include two assistants to Education Secretary Arne Duncan, as well as education policy advisers and associates in the offices of Senators Harry Reid and Al Franken and Representative George Miller.
KIPPs reputation has earned it the moniker  Kids In Prison Program  for its schools draconian disciplinary policies .
The most notorious of Teach For Americas political operatives is alumna Michelle Rhee, who in her last year as Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools was the hero of the 2010 feature film Waiting For Superman. The documentary, a masterpiece of modern propaganda, is unreserved in its exploitation of working-class families, to sell to the public the kinds of policies that made those families desperate enough to be used in such a way to begin with.
Director Davis Guggenheim narrates and, over heart-wrenching images of young black and brown children surrounded by urban decay, gives away the plot with an astonishing claim: For generations, he says, experts tended to blame failing schools on failing neighborhoods. But reformers have begun to believe the opposite: that the problems of failing neighborhoods might be blamed on failing schools.
Here the word failing, of course, is a euphemism for poor . After all, what does it mean for a neighborhood to fail? On the other hand, it is an empirical fact *that public schools in poorer districts are poorly funded. But this rhetorical sleight-of-hand is emblematic of TFAs explicitly outlined strategy for countering negative press.
An internal memo, made public last year in a story for the Nation , paints a frightening picture of TFAs outsize political power. According to the memo, an unnamed source inside the Department of Education tipped off the organization that TFA alumna and Nation reporter Alexandra Hootnick had filed a large FOIA request on Teach For America, indicating that she was unlikely to portray TFA in a positive light. In response, TFA utilized its press connections, website, and social media accounts to do pre-emptive damage control.
The memo also describes how TFA monitors internet communications to pick up on controversy surrounding its brand and neutralize it before it grows. Its rapid response to online criticism of Mother Jones for running a TFA advertisement show that its PR team has media manipulation down to an exact science:
As soon as we saw this conversation beginning to build our communications team drafted a short response (see appendix) which shared the overwhelming positive reception wed received from the magazines readers and our disappointment that a small group would use this as an opportunity to rehash factually inaccurate information and distract attention from the critical issue of early childhood education.
We posted this response on our On The Record page within a few hours of the detractors making noise and tweeted it out from our national handle twice because the conversation wasnt immediately dying (Tweet 1 (April 30) and Tweet 2 (May 1)). These tweets generated 5 posts from 5 unique supporters and a Twitter reach of 107,519 (the @teachforamerica Twitter handle represented 106,131 of the 107,519 supporters) and a Twitter exposure of 213,621. There were 269 clicks on the link to the On The Record page. At this point the conversation died.
Although the world wide web has created novel means of disseminating information, the basic strategy of utilizing mass media to influence public opinion  and, by extension, public policy  has been around for a long time. The propagandist Edward Bernays , widely regarded as the founder of the public relations industry, articulated this method in a 1955 paper entitled  The Engineering of Consent . Declaring that only by mastering the techniques of communication can leadership be exercised fruitfully in the vast complex that is modern democracy in the United States, Bernays insists that leaders should not seek to inform the public, but manipulate it:
With pressing crises and decisions to be faced, a leader frequently cannot wait for the people to arrive at even general understanding. In certain cases, democratic leaders must play their part in leading the public through the engineering of consent to socially constructive goals and values. This role naturally imposes upon them the obligation to use the educational processes, as well as other available techniques, to bring about as complete an understanding as possible.
 TFA monitors internet communications to pick up on controversy surrounding its brand and neutralize it before it grows.
The intersection of education, politics, and wealth thus made public school systems ideal breeding grounds for a public relations leviathan. Not only does privatizing schools create new opportunities for profit, it provides cover for class warfare in general, while subjecting*teachers and students to a fundamentally ideological*process. Writing for the Nation, George Joseph expounds on this concept:
For decades, sociological research has shown that anti-poverty measures, not energetic young college students, are the driving factors in improved education outcomes. Yet for over twenty years TFAs organizational model has been based upon the idea that a college student, fresh from a five-week summer camp, could swoop into [a]*poor, overcrowded classroom and inspire her students to overcome all barriers of structural inequality. Thus, the fundamental premise of Teach For America elides this need for wealth redistribution, perhaps explaining TFAs massive corporate donor appeal.
Teach For America doesnt just have an extensive PR apparatus; it is an extensive PR apparatus. Bruce Dixons suspicions about Ferguson were*fully justified, for as he notes, TFA is backed to the tune of hundreds of millions per year by Wal-Mart , the Broad Foundation, Monsanto and a long list of corporate villains and hedge fund predators intent upon dismantling, destroying and privatizing public education in black and brown neighborhoods, turning public education into a private profit center.
Thats precisely what Michelle Rhee did when, in her first year as chancellor, she closed 23 schools and fired 157 D.C. Public Schools employees, including 36 principles. By the end of her tenure, 682 teachers represented by the Washington Teachers Union  most of them black  lost their jobs.
Teach For America proved indispensable in that endeavor, as it supplied a reserve army of inexperienced recruits to replace tenured teachers in the few schools that had not been shuttered, and to staff the dozens of new charter schools that sprang up around the District, enticed by Rhees school*voucher scheme. Among its foot soldiers in that period was the woman Bruce Dixon would later accuse of being a trojan horse: Brittany Packnett, who began her career in 2007 as a TFA corps member at Martin Luther King Elementary School in Southeast D.C.
Not only does privatizing schools create new opportunities for profit, it provides cover for class warfare in general.
Thanks in part to the notoriously racialized political landscape of Washington, D.C., the publicity surrounding Michelle Rhee represented a growing liability for TFA. The ensuing backlash ended Adrian Fentys mayorship, and then grew in response to the situation in New Orleans, where education reform reached its apex in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 7,500*teachers were laid off in the midst of*the prolonged humanitarian disaster that followed*severe and widespread flooding in the city of New Orleans,*while the number of TFA recruits quadrupled . In May 2011*Governor Bobby Jindal appointed TFA alumnus John White to be*superintendent of the New Orleans Recovery School*District. White closed every single public school that remained, making the RSD*the first all-charter school district in the country (he*was promoted to state superintendent the next year).
The disproportionate devastation of these*policies for*black communities created a race problem for Teach For America. In response to the growing backlash, TFA doubled down on its liberal rhetoric and began to re-brand itself as a Civil Rights organization . Selling such an image necessitated a new class of political operatives, one that was majority-led by the oppressed group. *So when protests erupted in the majority-black town of Ferguson, Missouri on August 9th, 2014, TFA saw its window of opportunity.
Most people who followed the story from the beginning will recognize the name Antonio French. The alderman from St. Louis might justifiably be credited with making the police execution of Michael Brown a national headline. For the first several weeks, thanks to his prolific tweeting, French was among the most visible personalities on the ground in the now-infamous midwestern suburb, garnering profiles in national publications like the Washington Post , and TV spots on CNN .
On August 21st, 2014, in a post that has since been retweeted 1,342 times, French announced that Teach for America had set up shop in Ferguson . This wasnt merely on-the-ground reporting, but free publicity from a man whose business connections with TFAs St. Louis chapter were well-established. Two years prior, French had founded a non-profit in St. Louis modeled after the Harlem Childrens Zone, a pioneer*of the charter school*industry. Among the North Campuss recruits were staff who had originally come to St. Louis to teach as TFA corps members, and by May 2013 , French had brokered an official partnership between North Campus and TFA St. Louis .
Frenchs partner in the deal was Brittany Packnett, who by then was executive director of TFA St. Louis. The rapport they developed over the next year surely made it easier for Packnett to establish herself among the nascent protest movements purported leadership. Twitter conversations between them suggest that Packnett was in Ferguson as early as August 12th. She publicized Antonio Frenchs arrest on August 14th and, on the same day, declared her revolutionary love for St. Louiss Black children in a rather incoherent post on TFAs official blog:
Education didnt save Mike Brown. Racism killed him. There seems to be only one solution-end racism [sic]. . . . [W]hile issues of inequitable education, unemployment and poverty contributed to this crisis, racism is the cause for Mikes death . . . We must love our students enough to engage in the hard work of active anti-racism, confronting our own biases and ensuring that we dismantle deadly systems of racial dominance and oppression.
Then, on August 16th, a new player joined the operation. As he tells it , Deray McKesson made the 8.5 hour trip from Minneapolis to Ferguson on August 16th under his own initiative, and on his own dollar. There is an air of mystery surrounding McKessons seemingly spontaneous appearance on the scene, but in any case, he soon found his place among the Teach For America cohort. That much was inevitable. Deray Mckesson is also a TFA alumnus, and his enthusiasm for education reform is evident.
Mckesson was present with Antonio French and Brittany Packnett the day Teach For America began its Ferguson campaign in earnest on August 21st, 2014. He joined French in publicizing the event on twitter, while TFA began the work of curating his public image on the same day, with a feature on the TFA blog .
When protests erupted in the majority-black town of Ferguson, Missouri on August 9th, 2014, TFA saw its window of opportunity.
Before long, McKesson supplanted French as a go-to source for live updates on the ground in Ferguson, aided by promotion from Teach for America. On October 29th , TFA advertised a national conference call featuring TFA alumni @MsPackyetti [Brittany Packnett] and @deray. The Washington Post profiled McKesson in an article published November 13th, and TFA promoted it on social media , identifying him once again as a TFA alumnus. On Dec. 10, Time Magazine named him and several others, collectively referred to as the Ferguson protesters, as runner-up to Person of the Year  and again, TFA promoted it .
A simple twitter search query reveals this trend, right on up to TFAs big break: a cover story in the May 4th issue of the New York Times Magazine, under the headline  Our Demand Is Simple: Stop Killing Us.  The 6700-word article profiles McKesson and fellow overnight superstar protester Johnetta Elzie, as they drop in to protests in cities across the United States (whos paying for it all is never explained). According to the Times , the two got together in mid-September, under Brittany Packnetts leadership, to produce a newsletter for the Ferguson protests called This is the Movement, which boasted a wide range of readers, from reporters to protesters to officials within the Department of Justice. (In actuality, the newsletter was simply a collection of links to articles from various external publications, a few charities, and several T-shirt vendors.)
Twitter is the revolution, Mckesson is Quote: d as saying, in an utterance that has*gone on to*become his mantra. TFA, of course, benefits from the illusion that social media is inherently liberatory; as we have seen, twitter has proven to be an immensely useful tool in their million-dollar PR arsenal. And so we learn just how much Mckesson has in common with his influencer Michelle Rhee:
After graduating in 2007, Mckesson joined Teach for America and taught middle school for two years in East New York, Brooklyn, before moving back home to Baltimore to work in H.R. for the citys schools. He developed a reputation as a ruthless administrator  every hiring and firing was justified, in his own mind, by what was best for the kids in the district.
When one imagines a revolutionary activist following in the footsteps of the Civil Rights movement, a ruthless human resources administrator does not usually come to mind. But that is the Superman at the heart of the neoliberal narrative pushed by the education reform movement. Yesterday*it was Michelle Rhee and John White; today, Brittany Packnett and Deray Mckesson represent the superheroes we have been waiting for.
The post-Katrina privatization coup was the culmination of years of economic restructuring in New Orleans following the disaster, which former Secretary of Education famously called the best thing that*happened to education in New Orleans. The concept behind this phenomenon was identified by Naomi Klein in her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine . Klein illustrates, using New Orleans and occupied Baghdad as*case studies, that disaster capitalism is a predatory policy framework that depends on the chaos brought about by catastrophic events to recuperate public infrastructure and cede it to corporations. No wonder, then, that TFA operatives like Mckesson keep showing up in cities like Baltimore when the threat of rioting looms large.
Mckesson was present with Antonio French and Brittany Packnett the day Teach For America began its Ferguson campaign in earnest.
While Mckesson was busy shoring up TFAs brand, making the rounds on the cable news circuit and garnering praise for such intellectual feats as , Brittany Packnett swiftly moved up the ranks of the political class. In November 2014, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon named her to the 16-person panel on the Ferguson Commission . The next month she joined the Dream Defenders Phil Agnew and a handful of others in a private meeting with President Obama in the White House.
The meeting evidently paid off, as Packnett was subsequently selected for the Presidents Task Force On 21st Century Policing. One of the co-chairs under which she would work was former D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey, whose own civil rights violations against protesters were so severe that in 2009 the city was forced to pay them $8.25 million in damages.
The task forces final report , predictably, ignored any substantive economic analysis in favor of milquetoast reforms. These recommendations found further expression in the much-ballyhooed Campaign Zero , a watered-down platform launched by Brittany Packnett and Deray Mckesson, who make up half the campaigns planning team.
For their efforts, the two were rewarded last July with a $10,000 prize from Teach For America, who named them the winners of the 2015 Peter Jennings Award for Civic Leadership . Antonio French got his, too, in the form of a $500,000 grant for his St. Louis non-profit from the state of Missouri.
Meanwhile, the future of the protest movement they helped build is uncertain. For all the protestations that black lives matter, Teach For Americas crimes against black communities have gone largely unchecked, shielded by its near-hegemonic public relations empire. The movement lives.
The movement is also spreading its tentacles across national borders. Teach For All, founded by Wendy Kopp in 2007, claims affiliates in 37 countries , where globetrotting alumni have exported the TFA brand . Teach For India , Teach For Lebanon , and Enseña por Colombia are among the fruits of the second half*of the movement.
Teach First Israel, which claims schools in occupied Jerusalem , is particularly worrisome. According to its website , TFI was launched in partnership with*JDC*(a Zionist resettlement foundation ) and the Israeli Ministry of Education. Not only is Kopps foundation thus directly implicated in Israels violations of international law, each of its litany of corporate donors *consequently* meet the standards for boycott from the growing international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. Now that thats out in the open, perhaps a silver lining can*be found in the potential for new forms of joint struggle between Palestinians and the United States black underclass.
Teach For Americas goal of One Day, All Children isnt a promise; its a threat. Thats worth remembering on*February 5th, the day TFA*descends on*Washington to celebrate its 25th anniversary.

Originally Posted By: Joe90_guy The HTHS test and the Kurt Oban shear test are two distinct tests. The KO test pushes oil through a fuel injector to induce permanent shearing of the oil. Once the test is complete, you simply measure the standard kinematic viscosity of the oil at 100C. The result is then compared to the lower KV100 limit of your vis grade (12.5 min for an 5W40 or 9.3 min for a 5W30. I suspect if you took the sheared oil from KO and put it through HTHS it might be lower than normal but I've never run that test. As you might expect, running a 90 cycle KO is more extreme than a 30 cycle test. It's not, as you might expect, three times more extreme as there's a limit to how much you can chew up VI molecules. Shellvis VI is 'clever' in that it's pretty good on KO30 even though it's relatively poor on HTHS. However if you extend KO out to 90 cycles, its inherent fragility becomes more apparent. Thinking about this, this wouldn't affect 5W30 Euro top tier but 5W40 & 0W40 would be impacted. Euro OCP VIs tend to be far more robust so wouldn't be greatly affected by a switch from 30 to 90 cycles. However, doing top tier with OCP is far from easy as you are dealing with so much more rubber in the oil. Hope this helps... Great posts in this thread!

Thanks to @schoeny and the crew @simplymeasured for #LIFTSocial today. Had some great chats!
Surprised the dealer didn't just flush it, opting for a drain and filter instead. Tells me they thought the fluid was in bad shape, hesitant to flush. Use the highlighted text above as a guide what to do. The drain and fill is slightly under 4qts. if the level is good, simply measure what comes out. Also check the drain bolt. May be a 10mm hex socket like mine. Not a common socket to have around. http://www.sears.com/lisle-corp-3-8-driv...p;blockType=G11 The transmission bolt is less tight than an oil drain bolt.

You likely did zero damage with it on the lower line. I fill mine to have it near the max line, but not necessarily ON the max line. Because draining/refilling a Honda AT is so easy, and there's no external filter to change, I simply measure the fluid I get out and put exactly that much back in. Even if it shows high or low directly after the fill (before I drive it), I know that after I drive it for the first time, it will be exactly where it was before I began. Of course, I do check it periodically, but the level never changes on our two. _________________________ Cheers, Jason 2009 Honda Ridgeline RTL 2005 Acura MDX Touring

I use my Tupperware Quick Shake container very often because I like to make homemade marinades and salad dressings and vinaigrettes. This container makes preparing these items a cinch because I can simply measure the ingredients into the container and give it a few shakes and I'm done. This container eliminates the splashes on the counter that I sometimes would encounter while vigorously whisking some new concoction I was creating in a mixing bowl. Plus, I can shake it one-handed while moving from one part of the kitchen to the other completing tasks with my free hand. It has definitely been a more convenient and time-saving way to make delicious marinades, salad dressings and vinaigrettes than any other methods I have tried in the past. It is one of my favorite housewarming gifts to give to friends who like to cook and bake as much as I do. I just purchase a new Tupperware shaker, print off a few of my favorite recipes and package it with kitchen towels and wash clothes that will compliment their kitchen decor and it is a big hit. They love it.

^^^ pretty good post until you commented on fuel quality. Simply not true, octane is simply measured differently now. To the OP, watch the throat of the carb as you move the linkage from idle stop. At the SLIGHTEST movement there should be fuel squirted. If not you may get a stumble. That big motor needs a large sustained squirt as it comes up off idle. You may also have the timing off, retarded timing may cause a bog off idle. Forget the springs as they aren't playing a part at slow engine speeds. _________________________ "In a democracy, dissent is an act of faith." J.

May be a 10mm hex socket like mine. Not a common socket to have around. http://www.sears.com/lisle-corp-3-8-driv...p;blockType=G11 The transmission bolt is less tight than an oil drain bolt. Pay attention to the effort coming off. As I indicated,I have owned/own several Lexus/Toyota cars and have done numerous ATF drain/fills and total replacements via the cooler line, so I have the 10mm hex. Based on my experience with Lexus dealers, I wouldn't read anything into the fact they didn't do a flush. In fact, the two dealers I have experience with did not even have a flush machine and did only drain/fills.

However, you need to read the whole article. quote: Please keep in mind that the obvious thing lacking in everything that I have done is REAL testing of the filter media in terms of what it can and cannot trap. I don't have the ability to do that. I just looked at the overall contruction of the filters and determined the area & volume for the filtering media. Take a look for yourself and draw your own conclusions. If you check out the oil filter threads you will find that the filter media is more important than the area of filter material. You can not tell the difference in performance by simply measuring the filter media area. Yes, I would go back to the Paper air filter. The oil filter seems fine, even Blackstone say so.

Not going to lie, the amount of incredibly amazing feedback I got today from people who came up to me to thank me for my presentation, told me that I inspired them, made them laugh, taught them how to connect the dots to take data into action, inspired them to write their goals, etc.... It was so incredibly overwhelming and at first I kinda thought the first couple people were just being nice to make small talk.  That in fact was not the case at all.  People went out of their way to meet me, tell me their stores, ask me advice, and tell me that I inspired them.... I cannot even put into words how humbling and honored I am for this opportunity to have been here on this platform to speak to 300-400 insanely intelligent people and know that I left a mark in their lives.  Just getting back to my hotel to see all the feedback on Twitter and no joke it's kind of emotional.  I met some really incredible people today and want to say thank you to @SimplyMeasured for the opportunity to be here and to everyone I met, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.  #LIFTSocial #socialmedia #work #ufcsocial #smsports

My physical therapists were great people, but this I s SO true. Not only did they know nothing positive about weight training, but they were full of the #physicaltherapist version of #broscience . "You must not squat down so that your legs are bent more than a 90° angle." "You must not hold your breath while doing hard things." And I did often wonder how often they were provoking improvement and to what extent they were simply measuring my body healing. #stroke #ischemic #ischemicstroke #strokesurvivor #strokerecovery #strokerehab #startingstrength #stronglifts #lifting #progressiveoverload

OK, here's some cool info, thanks to some very helpful responses from both Wix and Baldwin... Wix Filter Media in Square Inches: #51568 - 242.489 #51381 - 223.727 #51626 - 214.716 #51347 - 211.227 #51344 - 192.15 #51064 - 149.917 #51334 - 133.575 #51356 - 93.075 And here's a mysterious red-haired stepchild I came across on the Web: Balwin #B168 -Application: Various Yanmar diesel engines -Area: 212.6 sq in -Dia: 3" -Length: 5-3/32" -Threads: 20mm x 1.5 mm -Gasket: 2.391" OD, 2.141" ID, 0.203" thick (cross-references to Wix #51568, which has the same gasket as stock Honda filters, although just slightly thinner) -Bypass: 8 psi -Anti-drainback Valve: Yes -Media: "Microlite" cellulose/fiberglass blend, "a 12 micron filter," 23 micron absolute, 8 micron nominal. -Made by: Baldwin in South Dakota, not sourced out -Available through: Various places, including http://www.go2marine.com/frameset.jsp?servletPath=/g2m&action=GoBPage&id=87018F&preview=false And here's an example of how bypass valve settings are just plain psychotic. These three filters are the "stock" replacement filters suggested by these manufacturers for my 2002 Mopar with the Mitsubishi 3.0L V-6: Fleetguard #LF3462: 8 psi Wix #51064: 16 psi Hastings #LF402: 20 psi Looks like the 16 psi Wix #51568 kicks some serious buttock for those who have an extra 1" of space under their hood. For those who want 8 psi (for whatever reason), the well-hung 5" long Baldwin B168 is intriguing. Lastly, keep in mind that these filters may not necessarily work even if the gasket is right and the clearances are there, depending on the length of the block's threaded stud. Some Subarus, for example, have short studs, and therefore require filter bases which are more convex than others, limiting their "oversize" options. You therefore want to count the threads in the filter base and make sure the filter turns at least that number of turns (plus a turn or two) before butting against the block. Or simply measure the clearance from the gasket surface to the start of the threads, comparing to your "stock" filter.

"In response to the main article's claims:

""requiring such labels, as a ballot measure in California seeks to do, could ""mislead and falsely alarm consumers.""

In order for this to be true, we would have to assume that people cannot think for themselves. I hope that people can think for themselves and have some self-esteem to recognize this statement as not only inaccurate but condescending.

Is it misleading and alarming for existing food labels to indicate how much sugar, how many calories, how much protein, how much vitamin A, how much carbohydrate is in a product? Why is this not considred misleading and faslely alarming to consumers?

What's more, these are simply measures of naturally occurring components of food (fat, carbs, protein, vitamins, etc). In asking for labeling we are asking to be informed not about natural, generally benign, endogenous proponents of food (which already are deemed important enough to put on labels), but untested geentically engineered stuff and their attendant herbicde residues! F

""""Consuming foods containing ingredients from GM crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques,""

The testing has not been done, nor has the increased pesticide residues and increasingly toxic cocktail of current and future generations of herbicides and pesticides been tested for safety. This is a typical brainwashing, false-security statement by government agencies banking on the hoped for ignorance and poor common sense of the average person. Commons sense alone tells us that we should at the very least be very concerned about foods such as the Bt group of GMOs that produce their own insecticide inside the plant (endogenously)."

"You could skip this and just use the gray paint you’re using for the elbow pads.
Total Price as Listed: $195.92
$159 if you already have black boots and a black t-shirt. Assembly
These instructions are grouped by part for ease of reference, but all the painting (elbow pads, goggles) and hot glueing (hose connector, belt fobs, and gizmo) can be done at the same time, while dyeing the belt. 1.1 Uniform
The khaki jumpsuit should be worn baggy to match the look of the films. The Tru-Spec suit has the correct assortment of pockets, rounded collar, zipper, and tone of the film. I wear a small or a medium in most shirts and ordered a medium. The pants are really long and baggy, but if you wear clothing underneath as they’re intended and tuck the legs into the boots, the fit fills out.
Each Ghostbuster always wears a black crew neck t-shirt underneath. 1.2 Patches
The most iconic parts of the costume after the khaki jumpsuit are the No Ghost logo and name patches. These are super easy to apply, no sewing required!
Begin by removing the attached velcro name patch that comes on the jumpsuit. I had considered, and you can as well, leaving this on and using it to afix the custom name patch to the suit so that it could be swapped for other names later if I wanted. The reason I didn’t go this route is because the name patch would be raised due to the extra velcro behind it, and because the placement is incorrect according to the movie.
Notice in these screenshots that the left edge of the name patch is almost touching the main zipper. This is so when wearing a proton pack the straps don’t cover any of the name, which would happen with the traditional military placement.
Removing the velcro is a cinch, simply turn the suit inside out and use a knife to cut the thread loops holding it to the suit.
The No Ghost logo patch goes on the upper right arm. For proper placement, put on your elbow pads (tuck the extra material underneath the pads to recreate the movie look) and place the patch approximately half way between the edge of your shoulder and the top of the elbow pad.
The name patch goes on the upper left chest, and the left edge is approximately half an inch from the main zipper. Iron on Instructions
The patch seller as well as many forum members suggest sewing the patches on in addition to ironing. I chose not to do this because I don’t anticipate wearing it that often, but it’s always something you can do later if you need to.
Turn your iron to full heat. Place an old t-shirt between the iron and the patch and press and hold for 15 to 20 seconds. Pull the sleeve inside out, place the t-shirt between the iron and suit and press and hold to heat the back of the patch for another 15 to 20 seconds. Heating both the front and back ensures the adhesive is properly attached to the uniform.
Repeat this process for the name patch. 1.3 Hose & Hose Connector
The long, draping hose is an iconic part of the costume, which you shouldn’t omit. It adds visual complexity and texture, and without it the costume won’t look complete, even if an onlooker can’t put his finger on why.
The hose’s function is never addressed in the films, though in interviews Dan Aykroyd has suggested they’re astronaut / fighter pilot inspired catheter tubes. Which makes sense, if a common part of your job is getting the piss scared out of you.
The hose in the first film is a transparent yellow color and in Ghostbusters II it’s clear. Many on the forums suggest using yellow RIT dye, the same kind used on the belt, to tint the hose, but unfortunately when I tried that the color didn’t stay at all. Others suggested some other tinted liquids but I just didn’t think it would create a uniform stain to be worth experimenting with it. So, our hose is from Ghostbusters II.
In the film, the tube attaches to the uniform by a small connector that is sewn on, with several thread points around the perimeter: from Ghostbusters Fans
I chose to use a screw on PVC connector because it looks almost identical in shape to the real one, but also because it isn’t a permanent solution. It can be added and removed as necessary.
The PVC union has three parts, (A) a front connector that is threaded (this will be the visible part on the suit), (B) the back part that screws on to that on the inside of the uniform, and (C) a removable non-threaded female plug on the other end. We don’t need that part, so you can put that aside.
We use a threaded 1/2” PVC pipe nipple with a 1-1/8” length screwed into the front connector (A) to create a shape similar to the film’s. The 1/2” vinyl tubing slides into the nipple freely and to ensure it stays in, glue the inside of it with a little bit of hot glue.
The hose drapes down to about knee level or a little below, then comes back up and slides in to the back of the belt. Surprisingly, this is how the hose is connected in the films, it’s literally just tucked into the belt, which you can see at several points in the film, including in the photo of Ray above.
With the belt sized properly, you shouldn’t have a problem with it coming loose, but you could use another PVC union as we use on the front on the back if you’d like to create a more finished look. 1.4 Boots
If you already have black boots that have a combat boot design to them they should work just fine. The real boots from the movie are Vietnam-era Paratrooper Jump Boots, but those are hard to find for less than $100 so for this design we’ll Vietnam-era Jungle Boots for a similar look and profile. These are available on Amazon for around $30, and should also be readily available at your local Army Navy store. If you’re looking to create a super accurate version look specifically for Corcoran model 995 jump boots, these are available on Amazon for $150. (The boots in the film were made by Carolina.)
The flight suit legs tuck into the top of the boots and create a billowy look. If you want to adopt the laissez-faire attitude like Venkman, you can just let the legs fall over like normal pants. However, your flight suit legs will almost certainly be too long so you’d need to tailor them. You could use this method to shorten the legs without any sewing. 1.5 Slime
Since we’re going for the pack-less, tired and weathered Ghostbuster, we need some slime to show how hard we’ve been working. Finding a slime solution that wouldn’t stain the uniform was surprisingly tricky. At first I thought using laundry detergent would be smart: It’s the right consistency and the color works. Unfortunately quick research led me to discover that laundry detergent will stain if you let it dry on clothing.
So I went to the Ghostbusters boards and found an unlikely fix. The fine fans on the forum suggested wire pulling lubricant gel, which by design is clear, odorless, non-toxic, and doesn’t stain. I picked some up on Amazon and did some tests, and what do you know, it works as advertised.
It will dry eventually, but much slower than if you just used water alone. Don’t be afraid to really layer it on, the more you use, the longer it’ll last. 2. Elbow Pads
The elbow pads have an inconsistent color throughout both films ranging from light gray to a very dark gray, so no matter how you go about coloring them they’ll be screen accurate.
The elbow pads are created by spray painting white Volleyball knee pads . The knee pads have a distinct three section design, and also feature a black square patch on the inside elbow. At the time of this publishing, the ones I bought on Amazon are out of stock, likely because of Halloween coming up, but you can find similar ones at places like Sports Authority , which you can get free shipping on, or if the three section design isn’t important to you, you can get these single section knee pads for only $4 on Amazon .
The Ghostbusters forums frequently mention dyeing the knee pads with the same RIT dye as the belt, but when I tried this I found the actual foam pad didn’t take any color at all, and the non-cotton parts of the elastic band didn’t either, resulting in a white pad with a striped band.
Everyone else spray paints theirs, which is fast and easy and creates a great looking finished product. The paint does make the pads a bit fuzzy, but close inspection of the film reveals their pads also have this texture.
To ensure the elastic is a consistent gray when expanded on your arm, slide the pads onto a large cylinder such as a protein shake tub. Use a good quality gray spray paint like the Krylon linked above. As with all spray painting, you’ll want to hold the can about 15 inches from the pads and slowly cover the area. The pads dry quickly so give it 2-3 coats to make sure you get into all the nooks.
Once that’s done mask off a square on the inside of the band and paint that black. 3.1 The Utility Belt
The gray belt is equally important as the gray elbow pads and leg hose for creating the screen accurate look. To create the belt, we’re using a white cotton web military belt and dyeing it gray with RIT fabric dye.
Do not be intimidated by the dye process, it’s extremely simple and is super fast. When using RIT dye you can use a bucket or use a washing machine. I live in a building with shared laundry so I chose the bucket method just in case any stray dye was left in the machine for the next person.
Pour extremely hot water into a bucket – I used an electric kettle – along with the powdered RIT Dye and 2 cups of salt, per the package instructions. Stir the powder into the water and then place the belt in the bucket. Press it into the gray water to ensure equal coverage.
Be careful with getting the stain on your hands, it can take awhile to get off. If only we had some sort of rubber gloves we could use…oh yes! Use your black chemical gloves that you bought for the costume to protect your hand from the stain.
Leave the belt in the stain for an hour, checking in and re-submerging it every 15 minutes or so. Once the belt is the color gray you like, remove it from the dye and let it dry, obviously being careful with what you let it touch. When mine was dry the metal parts of the belt had a gray coating on them that wiped off with a wet paper towel. Make sure you do that so it doesn’t get on anything else.
The belts are sizable, simply find the folded over end with the two hooks on it and place them in the appropriate holes to give you the long enough length. 3.2 The Key Fobs
In the film each Ghostbuster has their own set of key fobs attached to their belts above their right leg. These are used to store both the neutrona wand from the pack as well as the trap.
Unfortunately this is one of the items that isn’t available on Amazon at a decent price. Created with a combination of bolt snaps, key rings, and leather loops, similar real-world options are $10+ each . Even at a local hardware store, the bolt snaps are $4 a piece.
The solution is dirt cheap! Go to your local dollar store and buy two dog leashes. I actually found these brown leashes at Rite Aid for $1 each.
Take one of the leashes, and starting from the bolt end, cut the leash about 8 inches, leaving it attached to the bolt. Create a loop that is big enough for the belt to slide through and hot glue the cut end back to the bolt end.
Remove the bolt from the second leash and connect it to the looped bolt. Voila! $2 belt fobs. 3.3 Belt Gizmo
Above the Ghostbuster’s uniform hose connector is an electronic gadget holstered on the belt that’s known as the Belt Gizmo. This item is never explained (some speculate it’s some type of readout for the proton pack) and is just present to beef up the utility belt.
This item is the least screen accurate part of our costume. The film’s gizmo is created with a Sanyo ICC-808D calculator circuit board, some nixie tubes , a coiled wire, as well as some various other electronic components and is attached to the belt with a black leather holster. I felt recreating this was a little too far down the rabbit hole for this project. However you can find plans on building your own or you can buy them off of eBay.
To create something with a similar effect, buy a large button calculator from the dollar store. Remove the faceplate by unscrewing the screws on the back. Inside you’ll find rubber or plastic buttons, a paper circuit board, small solar panel, and the screen. Take a moment, play with it and be surprised at how something so simple can calculate complex math. Incredible.
Anyway, take your hot glue gun and glue the screen, solar panel, and paper circuit board in place. Cut a 5 inch section of your dollar store dog leash and hot glue that to the back of the calculator to create a belt loop. 3.4 Gloves
While you can wear the gloves if you want, I like draping them over the belt like the Ghostbusters do. It adds more complexity to the belt, and your hands won’t be sweating the whole time.
The chemical gloves from Amazon are long; longer than they should be for the first film. The second film’s gloves are about as long as the Amazon ones, but I like the way the shorter ones look both when worn and when draped over the belt.
Simply measure the gloves to about 12 inches and cut them with scissors. 4. Ecto Goggles
The Ecto Goggles are shown in use during the Sedgwick Hotel scene in Ghostbusters, as well as in the montage of Ghostbusters II, but are seen resting atop Ray and Egon’s heads throughout both. It may be tempting to skip the goggles, and if you’re in a mad dash to finish the costume you could forgo them, but having them on your head really takes the costume to the next level and they’re super cheap and super easy to put together.
The real goggles were created by using the base of surplus military night vision goggles model number AN/PVS-5a , which you can find on eBay if you want. A lot of dedicated fans and prop makers use the real deal for their goggles, unfortunately due to the demand from the Ghostbusting community, these non-working useless military surplus command prices of $50+. You can also splurge and pay $110 for the Mattel version .
Instead, we’re going to use similarly shaped welding goggles from Hobart. Our DIY version will cost less than $17, with the most noticeable difference between these and the real deal is the third strap that goes over the top of the head. The only other parts to the goggles are three PVC pipe pieces, two shoulder bolts screwed into the pipes to mimic optic adjusters, spray paint, and free printable labels.
The welding goggles and spray paint can be picked up on Amazon, the labels can be printed for free, but unfortunately the 3 PVC pipe parts need to be purchased at your local hardware store. Locally they cost around $.68 each but on Amazon they’re upwards of $9. That’s crazy.
The external lenses are made of three PVC parts. The lens on the actor’s right are made of two pieces, to create a 3 tiered shape, and the lens on the actors left is made of one piece that is about half as long as the completed right piece.
Here’s what you need. 3/4” x 1” reducing female adapter ($.64 at Home Depot) 1” x 3/4” PVC female adapter ($.64 at Home Depot) 1/2” female adapter ($.36 at Home Depot) Two 5/16″ x 1/2″ shoulder bolts ($1.57 at Home Depot), which are in the drawers in the fastener section Green and silver/gray spray paint.
These are common fittings but they do come in different shapes, so if your local store doesn’t have the exact ones I used, you should be able to find something that will still work.
The welding goggles are a green/teal color already so if you’re short on time you can skip painting them the olive drab color. To paint, remove the strap and the various black plastic vents from the goggles. They just pop out and are easy to pop back in. Cut out two circles the size of the base of the two largest PVC parts from masking tape and place them on the front lens of the welding goggles.
Drill a hole in the side of each of the two lens bases for the shoulder bolts to screw into. These are our “lens” adjusters. Where you drill in the bases doesn’t matter, you’ll place the bolts based on their orientation when you glue them to the goggles.
Spray paint the goggles dark green. Spray paint the two larger PVC parts black, and the smaller 1/2” female adapter silver. If you don’t want to buy silver spray paint, you can use the same gray that you used for the elbow pads. Take two of the black plastic vents that you removed from the goggles and paint those gray also. These will mimic the knobs on the goggles.
As with the elbow pads, do multiple passes for consistent coverage.
Once everything is painted, remove the two masking tape circles from the goggles. Screw in the two shoulder bolts. Glue the silver female adapter to the smaller 3/4” adapter. I used black silicone to connect those two pieces, as well as attach the lenses to the goggles, but you could also use hot glue. Use whatever is convenient and quick drying.
Once everything is dry and glued together. the last step is to stick on our labels. The labels below were created and donated to the community by Hprops and Ghosthead . Click on those links and print out the labels at 100%. (Both sets of labels have extras.) Cut out the labels and use a glue stick to place them. Label placement diagram by Demon Vice Commander 5. Cigarette
All of the Ghostbusters except for Egon are shown smoking throughout the first film. They’re hard-working exterminators and it was the 80’s. You could skip the cigarette but then you’d miss out on doing the classic Ray-surprised-by-Slimer look. The Ecto-1
I want to give a shout out to Sean B., whose immaculate Ecto-1 is featured in our photos. It’s identical to the film version, and I was genuinely blown away when I saw it in person. A true artist, most of the components were custom made from measurements Sean took from the real vehicle when it was sitting rotting on the film lot. In fact, after the recent restoration of the film car where some liberties were taken, Sean’s Ecto is actually more screen accurate than the real thing. And if his Ecto-1 doesn’t have you jealous yet, he also has a wall of Proton Packs and used to own a converted DeLorean Time Machine. A huge thanks to Sean for letting us photograph with his beautiful car and for being one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met."

The article seems to say that Merck is trying to avoid another "pink slime" PR nightmare and that the withdrawl is only temporary and only in the US and Canada.<br/><br/>But, it also contains this:<br/><br/>&gt; While markets such as China and the European Union have banned imports of meats raised with beta-agonists, in the United States, more than 70 percent of U.S. beef cattle that go to slaughter do so after consuming a regimen of beta-agonist drugs, according to industry estimates.<br/><br/>This makes me wonder if the EU hasn't come up with a test to identify meat tainted by Zilmax and this is Merk's way of ensuring that exported meat isn't caught.  The EU has become more agressive in testing imports and if they find that most US beef is tainted, that would shut down US exports for quite a while until it is sorted out.<br/><br/>What is really sad is that the FDA permits this for US consumers, but China has banned imports using this stuff?<br/><br/>An NPR article on this issue: http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/08/09/210538430/did-tyson-drop-zilmax-fed-beef-to-appease-foreign-buyers<br/><br/>&gt; China, and many countries in the European Union have banned the use of these drugs in meat production. In May, Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, announced it would cut in half its purchase of animals raised with a similar drug, ractopamine. Just a week later, Smithfield its sale to a Chinese company.<br/>

On the Banks of Squaw Creek: Ractopamine and Turkeys: A Response to #FoodBabe http://t.co/FkgXF9OFXN #foodchat #health #thanksgivingdinner
<3 You gotta love Joel Salatin! <3   Joel Salatin is co-owner of Polyface Organic Farms and author of half a dozen books on sustainable farming.The problem: Cattle evolved to eat grass, not grains. But farmers today feed their animals corn and soybeans (of which ~90% are GMO), Antibiotic Drugs & rBGH/rBST Bovine Growth Hormone Drugs to produce more Dairy Milk, and Ractopamine Steroid Growth Hormone Drugs, which fatten up the animals faster before slaughter. But more money for cattle farmers (and lower prices at the grocery store & Costco) means a lot less nutrition for us. A recent comprehensive study conducted by the USDA and researchers from Clemson University found that compared with corn-fed beef, grass-fed beef is higher in beta-carotene, vitamin E, omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), calcium, magnesium, and potassium; lower in inflammatory omega-6s; and lower in saturated fats that have been linked to heart disease. We need to respect the fact that cows are herbivores, and that does not mean feeding them GMO corn and chicken manure, says Salatin. The Solution: Buy only Grass-Fed Beef, which can be found at specialty grocers, farmers markets, and Natural Food Grocers like Whole Foods, PCC Natural Markets, or Trader Joe's. They are usually labeled because it demands a premium, but if you dont see it, ask your butcher. Even ranchers and farmers themselves won't eat GMO Corned-Fed Beef or their own Dairy Products so why would you eat them ?!?

Now I no longer Eat Pork,  Why?   Because it is an  abomination to my CREATOR:  "The Pig, though it has a split hoof, completely divided, yet does not chew the cud, it is UNCLEAN to you.   Their flesh you do not eat, and their carcass you do not touch. They are unclean to you." -  Wa'yiqra / Leviticus 11: 7-8  If we read Acts 10 we will see what has been made clean, it is not pork.:  Act 10:14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  Act 10:15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  Act 10:16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  Act 10:17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,  Act 10:18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  Act 10:19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  Act 10:20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  Act 10:21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  Act 10:22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  Act 10:23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  Act 10:24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.  Act 10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.  Act 10:26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  Act 10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.  Act 10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.   "Call no man unclean who has shown that he believes in YHWH " (This does not say to eat pork.)  Pork .......... has also been proven to be one of the biggest health hazard "foods" available!  (Who would have guessed our Creator knew what He what He was talking about when He said " they are unclean to you."   By Dr. Mercola:  "Regardless of your spiritual beliefs, there may be good reason to carefully consider your decision to include pork as a regular part of your diet, because despite advertising campaigns trying to paint pork as a "healthy" alternative to beef, research suggests it may be hazardous to your health on multiple levels. One of the most potentially acute hazards is contamination with pathogenic bacteria.  According to a surprising new investigation by Consumer Reports,:   69 percent of all raw pork samples tested  nearly 200 samples in total    were contaminated with the dangerous bacteria Yersinia enterocolitica,   which causes fever and gastrointestinal illness with diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.  Ground pork was more likely than pork chops to be contaminated.  The pork also tested positive for other contaminants, including the controversial drug ractopamine, which is banned in many parts of the world, including China and Europe.   The drug, which was found in more than 20 percent of the samples, is used to boost growth in the animal while leaving the meat lean.   Worst of all, many of the bacteria found in the pork were resistant to multiple antibiotics, making treatment, should you fall ill, all the more problematic and potentially lethal.  According to the featured report:  "We found salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes, more common causes of foodborne illness, in 3 to 7 percent of samples.   And 11 percent harbored enterococcus, which can indicate fecal contamination and can cause problems such as urinary-tract infections." ............  -  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/12/12/eating-pork.aspx   ****************************************************************   14 Things You should know about Pigs   by Rico Cortes  When you read this, it make you really understand how wise YHVH is.   Le 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.  De 14:8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.  1) A pig is a real garbage gut. It will eat anything including urine, excrement, dirt, decaying animal flesh, maggots, or decaying vegetables. They will even eat the cancerous growths off other pigs or animals.   2) The meat and fat of a pig absorbs toxins like a sponge. Their meat can be 30 times more toxic than beef or venison.  3) When eating beef or venison, it takes 8 to 9 hours to digest the meat so what little toxins are in the meat are slowly put into our system and can be filtered by the liver. But when pork is eaten, it takes only 4 hours to digest the meat. We thus get a much higher level of toxins within a shorter time.  4) Unlike other mammals, a pig does not sweat or perspire. Perspiration is a means by which toxins are removed from the body. Since a pig does not sweat, the toxins remain within its body and in the meat.  5) Pigs and swine are so poisonous that you can hardly kill them with strychnine or other poisons.  6) Farmers will often pen up pigs within a rattlesnake nest because the pigs will eat the snakes, and if bitten they will not be harmed by the venom.  7) When a pig is butchered, worms and insects take to its flesh sooner and faster than to other animals flesh. In a few days the swine flesh is full of worms.  8) Swine and pigs have over a dozen parasites within them, such as tapeworms, flukes, worms, and trichinae. There is no safe temperature at which pork can be cooked to ensure that all these parasites, their cysts,and eggs will be killed.  9) Pig meat has twice as much fat as beef. A 3 oz T bone steak contains 8.5 grams of fat; a 3 oz pork chop contains 18 grams of fat. A 3 oz beef rib has 11.1 grams of fat; a 3 oz pork spare rib has 23.2 grams of fat.  10) Cows have a complex digestive system, having four stomachs. It thus takes over 24 hours to digest their vegetarian diet causing its food to be purified of toxins. In contrast, the swines one stomach takes only about 4 hours to digest its foul diet, turning its toxic food into flesh.  11) The swine carries about 30 diseases which can be easily passed to humans. This is why God commanded that we are not even to touch their carcase (Leviticus 11:8).  12) The trichinae worm of the swine is microscopically small, and once ingested can lodge itself in our intestines, muscles, spinal cord or the brain. This results in the disease trichinosis. The symptoms are sometimes lacking, but when present they are mistaken for other diseases, such as typhoid, arthritis, rheumatism, gastritis, MS, meningitis, gall bladder trouble, or acute alcoholism.  13) The pig is so poisonous and filthy, that nature had to prepare him a sewer line or canal running down each leg with an outlet in the bottom of the foot. Out of this hole oozes pus and filth his body cannot pass into its system fast enough. Some of this pus gets into the meat of the pig.  14) According to Jewish law, pork is one of a number of foods fo

10 Foods Sold In The U.S. That Are Banned Elsewhere<br/>Posted January 3, 2014 6:36pm EST by OracleTalk Curator<br/><br/>This Article First Appeared At Care2.com:<br/><br/>Americans are slowly realizing that food sold in the US doesnt just taste different than foods sold in other countries, its created differently. Sadly, many U.S. foods are BANNED in Europe  and for good reason. Take a look at the plummeting health of Americans; what role might toxic foods play in our skyrocketing disease rates?<br/><br/>Below are 10 American foods that are banned elsewhere.<br/><br/>#1:  Farm-Raised Salmon<br/><br/>Farm-raised fish is usually fed an unnatural diet of genetically engineered (GE) grains, antibiotics and chemicals unsafe for humans. To mask the resulting grayish flesh, theyre given toxic and potentially eyesight-damaging synthetic astaxanthin.<br/><br/>To determine wild from farm-raised salmon (sold in most restaurants), wild sockeye gets its red color from natural astaxanthin and carotenoids. The white fat strips are thin, meaning its lean. Pale pink fish and wide fat marks are a sign of farmed salmon.<br/><br/>Avoid Atlantic Salmon. Look for Alaskan or sockeye, which is illegal to farm and has very high astaxanthin concentrations.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Australia and New Zealand<br/><br/>#2:  Genetically Engineered Papaya<br/><br/>Most Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered to be ringspot virus-resistant. But research shows animals fed GE foods like corn and soy suffer intestinal damage, multiple-organ damage, massive tumors, birth defects, premature death and/or nearly complete sterility by the third generation. Dangers to humans are unknown.<br/><br/>Where its banned: The European Union<br/><br/>#3:  Ractopamine-Tainted Meat<br/><br/>About 45 percent of US pigs, 30 percent of cattle and an unknown percentage of turkeys are plumped with the asthma drug ractopamine before slaughter. Up to 20 percent of ractopamine is still there when you buy it.<br/><br/>Since 1998, more than 1,700 US pork lovers have been poisoned this way. For this very health threat, ractopamine-laced meats are banned in 160 different countries! Russia issued a ban on US meat imports, effective February 11, 2013, until its certified ractopamine-free. In animals, its linked to reducedreproductive function, increased mastitis and increased death. It damages the human cardiovascular system and may cause hyperactivity, chromosomal abnormalities and behavioral changes. Currently, US meats arent even tested for it.<br/><br/>Where its banned: 160 countries across Europe, Russia, mainland China and Republic of China (Taiwan).<br/><br/>#4:  Flame Retardant Drinks<br/><br/>Mountain Dew and other drinks in the US contain the synthetic chemical brominated vegetable oil (BVO), originally patented as a flame retardant.<br/><br/>BVO bioaccumulates in human tissue and breast milk; animal studies report reproductive and behavioral problems. Bromine alters the central nervous and endocrine systems and promotes iodine deficiency, causing skin rashes, acne, loss of appetite, fatigue and cardiac arrhythmias. The featured article explains:<br/><br/>The FDA has flip-flopped on BVOs safety, originally classifying it as generally recognized as safe, but reversing that call, now defining it as an interim food additive, a category reserved for possibly questionable substances used in food.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Europe and Japan<br/><br/>#5:  Processed Foods and Artificial Food Dyes<br/><br/>More than 3,000 preservatives, flavorings and colors are added to US foods, many of which are banned in other countries. The featured article noted:<br/><br/>Boxed Mac & Cheese, cheddar flavored crackers, Jell-O and many kids cereals contain red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 and/or blue 2  (which) can cause behavioral problems as well as cancer, birth defects and other health problems in laboratory animals. Red 40 and yellow 6 are also suspected of causing an allergy-like hypersensitivity reaction in children. The Center for Science in the Public Interest reports that some dyes are also contaminated with known carcinogens.<br/><br/>In countries where these food dyes are banned, companies like Kraft employ natural colorants like paprika extract and beetroot.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Norway and Austria. Britain advised companies against using food dyes by the end of 2009. The European Union requires a warning notice on most foods containing dyes.<br/><br/>#6:  Arsenic-Laced Chicken<br/><br/>Arsenic-based drugs are approved in US-produced animal feed because they cause animals to grow quicker and meats products to look pinker and fresher. The FDA says arsenic-based drugs are safe safe because they contain organic arsenic  But organic arsenic can turn into inorganic arsenic, run through contaminated manure and leach into drinking water.<br/><br/>The European Union has never approved using arsenic in animal feed; US environmental groups have sued the FDA to remove them.<br/><br/>Where its banned: The European Union<br/><br/>#7:  Bread with Potassium Bromate<br/><br/>Bread, hamburger and hotdog buns are enriched with potassium bromate, or bromide, linked to kidney and nervous system damage, thyroid problems, gastrointestinal discomfort and cancer.<br/><br/>While commercial baking companies claim it renders dough more tolerable to bread hooks, Pepperidge Farm and others use only unbromated flour without experiencing structural problems.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Canada, China and the EU<br/><br/>#8:  Olestra/Olean<br/><br/>Olestra, or Olean, created by Procter & Gamble, is a calorie- and cholesterol-free fat substitute in fat-free snacks like chips and french fries. Three years ago, Time Magazine named it one of the worst 50 inventions ever. MSN noted:<br/><br/>Not only did a 2011 study from Purdue University conclude rats fed potato chips made with Olean gained weight  several reports of adverse intestinal reactions to the fake fat include diarrhea, cramps and leaky bowels. And because it interferes  with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K, the FDA requires these vitamins be added to any product made with Olean or olestra.<br/><br/>Where its banned: The UK and Canada<br/><br/>#9:  Preservatives BHA and BHT<br/><br/>BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) are common preservatives in foods like cereal, nut mixes, chewing gum, butter spread, meat and beer. The National Toxicology Programs 2011 Report on Carcinogens says BHA may trigger allergic reactions and hyperactivity and is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Both are banned in parts of the European Union and Japan; the UK doesnt allow BHA in infant foods.<br/><br/>#10:  Milk and Dairy Products Made with rBGH<br/><br/>Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a synthetic version of natural bovine hormone is injected into cows to increase milk production. Monsanto developed it from genetically engineered E. coli bacteria, marketed as Posilac.<br/><br/>But its banned in at least 30 other nations. Why? It converts normal tissue cells into cancerous ones, increasing colorectal, prostate and breast cancer risks. Among other diseases, injected cows suffer exorbitant rates of mastitis, contaminating milk with pus and antibiotics.<br/><br/>In 1997, two Fox-affiliate investigative journalists, Jane Akre and Steve Wilson attempted to expose thedangers of rBGH, but lawyers for Monsanto  a major advertiser with the Florida network  sent letters promising dire consequences if the story aired.<br/><br/>In 1999, the United Nations Safety Agency ruled unanimously not to endorse rBGH milk, resulting in an international ban on US milk.<br/><br/>The Cancer Prevention Coalition, trying for years to affect a dairy industry ban of rBGH, resubmitting apetition to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg in January 2010, but the FDA sticks to its false position that rBGH-treated milk is no different than milk from untreated cows.<br/><br/>Action: Look for products labeled rBGH-free or No rBGH.<br/><br/>Where its banned: Australi
#ractopamine banned in 100 countries allowed in the US. #govegan #meatismurder More than 12 months ago, both organizations submitted a public records request to the FDA, seeking records on physiological, psychological, and behavioral effects of ractopamine, according to an ALDF press release. Since that time, the FDA has produced only outdated data and unreasonably delayed the release of comprehensive records, in violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), continues the release.<br/><br/>Ractopamine is used to speed weight gain among animals raised for food, yet thats rarely the only side effect. Unintended consequences include toxicity; behavioral changes; and cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, reproductive, and endocrine problems. It is also associated with high stress levels in animals, downer or lame animals, hyperactivity, broken limbs, hoof lesions, and death, reports the ALDF. As a result, the European Union, China, Taiwan, and Russia ban or restrict the drug. FDAs illegal delay is deeply troubling. The human health effects of eating meat with traces of these drugs are not well known, and the data we do have is alarming.  The American people have a right to know what they are eating. What does the FDA have to hide? said Paige Tomaselli, senior attorney with Center for Food Safety.
This is why I eat only organic grassfed meat. Its expensive but its worth my family's health. Not to offend anyone tho, I do eat poisonous meat once in a while. Like yesterday at stop n shop, spent a few minutes looking grassfed beef all I found was grounded ones so I ended up buying the their beef. Sometimes convenience does play a big part in our lives but if not please buy grassfed meat as mush as possible. Support local farms, or health food stores, remember our gov dgaf about our health. #ractopamine #poisonmeat #beef #naturalnews

Makes a person wonder if ANYthing is safe to eat!    Yipes!  Smithfield Farms, the largest pork producing farm in the USA was sold in September to China with the unanimous support of its stockholders!! The hogs will still be raised here, but slaughtered and packaged for sale there before being sent back here. This includes labels of Morrell, Eckrich, Krakus, Cudahy, Premium Hams, Cook's, Gwaltney, The same with many chickens. They can now be shipped there, but when they come back all  that needs to be labeled is that they WERE RAISED IN THE USA. Not that they were processed in China!!! Our great FDA at work again.   The chickens will be all processed and most sold to fast food restaurants for sandwiches, along with schools and supermarkets. The China slaughter and processing are not nearly equal to the requirements here.  Sadly, there may be only one potential upside to this deal for most Americans, and that one is ironic. We might see a marginal improvement in the quality of industrially produced pork by ridding it of ractopamine, a lean-meat growth stimulant whose effects on humans are sufficiently questionable that its use for meat production is illegal in the European Union, Russia and China. Smithfield says that as of June, 50 percent of its pork is ractopamine-free, the better to please its new masters. But can Americans buy Smithfield pork without ractopamine? Maybe, maybe not. At the moment, theres no way to know.    *BAD FOOD.* We recently learned that Starkist Tuna is now owned by Korea , and is in big conflict with  the U. S. concerning quality, safety, and records, which Korea refuses to produce. I read several articles on Google about this, and even one that was  defending the eating of tilapia said to avoid the fish that came from China .? Also, I had just returned home from buying Albertson's 4-day special of 4 bags of frozen tilapia for the price of one.? Sure enough, on the top of the bags, it read "farm raised", and on the bottom in small print it said, " China "> read all the way down...  Recently a Food inspector on TV... said he had lived overseas and he had seen the filthy conditions their foods are raised and processed in. It is enough to make you throw up.  Some foreign workers have to wear masks as they work in these places, because the food is so rotten and filthy, it makes them want to throw up. Many of their fish on Fish Farms are fed raw sewage daily. He said he has seen so much filth throughout their food growing and processing that he would "never" eat any of it. They raise this filth, put some food coloring and some flavorings on it, then they ship it to the USA & Canada for YOU to consume and feed to YOUR families. They have no Food & Safety Inspectors. They ship it to you to buy and poison your families and friends .  Imported food we eat and the junk  we buy: Green Giant frozen vegetables are  from China, and so are most of Europe 's Best. Arctic Gardens are Okay. So is Birdseye.  *Never buy the grocery store garlic unless it is clearly marked from USA or Canada *, the other stuff is grown in people poop (even worse than chicken poop). China is the largest producer of garlic in the world; U. S. is next. *Buy only local honey *, much honey is shipped in huge containers from China and re-packed here.  Cold-FX is grown and packed in China and is full of fecal bacteria. Doesn't work anyway, big scam. If the country of origin is not clearly marked beware.  If produce, ask an employee.  Watch out for packages which state "prepared for", "packed by" or "imported by". We don't understand the lack of mandatory labeling, especially the produce.  The country of origin should be clearly shown on the item in the store.  Go to the local farmers' markets  in season and keep a wary eye open the rest of the year.  Please read this very carefully, and read to the very bottom. It's important for all of us.  How is it possible to ship food from China cheaper than having it produced in the U. S. or Canada?  FOR EXAMPLE THE "OUR FAMILY" BRAND  OF MANDARIN ORANGES SAYS RIGHT ON THE CAN 'FROM CHINA '. SO, FOR A FEW MORE CENTS, BUY THE LIBERTY BRAND. *GOLD BRAND OR THE DOLE IS FROM CALIFORNIA *.  Beware, Costco sells canned peaches and pears in  a plastic jar that come from China. ALL "HIGH LINER" AND MOST THER FROZEN FISH PRODUCTS COME FROM CHINA OR INDONESIA . THE PACKAGE MAY SAY "PACIFIC SALMON" ON THE FRONT, BUT LOOK FOR THE SMALL PRINT. MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS COME FROM FISH FARMS IN THE ORIENT WHERE THERE ARE NO REGULATIONS ON WHAT IS FED TO THESE FISH.  *Recently The Montreal Gazette had an article *by the Canadian Government on how Chinese feed the fish: They suspend chicken wire crates over the fish ponds, and the fish feed on chicken shit. If you search the internet about what the Chinese feed  their fish, you'll be alarmed; e. g, growth hormones, expired anti-biotic from humans.?  Never buy any type of fish or shellfish that comes from these countries: Vietnam, China , Philippines.Check this out personally.  Steinfeld's Pickles are made in India - just as bad!  Another example is in canned mushrooms. No-Name brand came from Indonesia ..Also check those little fruit cups. They used to be made in Canada in the Niagara region until about 2 years ago. They are now packaged in China. Most sold in Aldi stores.  While the Chinese export inferior and even toxic products, dangerous toys, and goods to be sold in North American markets, the media wrings its hands! Yet, 70% of North Americans believe that the trading privileges afforded to the Chinese should be suspended.  Well, duh! Why do you need the government to suspend trading privileges? SIMPLY DO IT YOURSELF, CANADA AND THE U. S.  Simply look on the bottom of every product you buy, and if it says 'Made in China ' or 'PRC' (and that now includes Hong Kong ), simply choose another product, or none at all. You will be amazed at how dependent you are on Chinese products, and you will be equally amazed at what you can do without.  THINK ABOUT THIS: If 200 million North Americans refuse to buy just $20 each of Chinese goods, that's a billion dollar trade imbalance resolved in our favor...fast!  The downside? Some Canadian/American businesses will feel a  temporary pinch from having foreign stockpiles of inventory. Just one month of trading losses will hit the Chinese for 8% of their North American exports. Then they will at least have to ask themselves if the benefits of their arrogance and lawlessness are worth it.  *START NOW and don't stop and tell your friends Send this to everybody you know. Let's show them that we are intelligent, and NOBODY can take us for granted. *Start reading labels more closely and buy something else even if it cost a few cents more.*
